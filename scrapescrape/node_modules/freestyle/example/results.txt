Heres a little story id like to tell about
 
How slow it all happened
Unnoticed and forgotten
Lost in the amazement
A shadow that trailed them
Sunshine and happiness
Laughter without guilt
No need for arguments
They understood and embraced the difference
But time was widdling Away
Ignorant and confident
It was not to be compared
And they agreed it was different
With promises of openness
Sealed with a. Kiss
Romeo and Juliet 
Without the death
They were joined at the hip
And in tune as it gets
From the very beginning
They were brand new kids
Adults in the orchard
And living under the same roof
Brought together by madness
Drunken confidence 
And loneliness 
Both missing tenderness
Hurt by what's happened
And ready to forget everything
Exactly what they were asking for
They were almost Leary of how perfect it was
And he almost didn't let it happen
But she was determined 
And it all happened
Promised commitment
And together till the end of it
He was romantic
And she the purest form of acceptance
They bloomed and blossomed so quick
He was her confidence that she lost in the wind
And she was his everything he never had as a kid
It could not have been a more balanced relationship
And a mushroom trip sealed it
Their spirits intertwined as they watched their friends dance to the music
Convinced it couldn't be coincidence 
And if it was didn't give a shit
They had no reason for desricptions or time for second thinking
Their only ambition was to be in it
In ways they had never been
Fully commited in every minute
An almost impossible challenge that many have challenged and very few have lasted
They stood proud as lovers and took off on an adventure that would be as spontaneous and unforgettable as the moment they met
Days of asking how they became the person the person eachother was so in love with
And nights of wondering how lucky they were to have found this
It was as if nothing before had ever happened
And they Held back nothing 
It was hurtful in ways but empowering more than anything
Each day passing was more proof they made the right decision 
She was captivated by him and all his goofy conversations 
And he was in awe of her and all the ways she lit up any room she was in
Time passed by as usual but was decorated with moments of slow motion that would forever be in their memories 
If ever there was anything greater
Let it be forever unknown to the lovers
Who cares when all is theirs
To the love slaves
There is no greater
Only theirs
  
  
 Asian woman, southbound from St. George to Queen's Park
 
We were standing beside each other on the subway this morning, me sneaking sideways glances at you, you noticing and smiling. You were wearing a white tshirt and black pants, I was wearing a light blue t and blue pants. I commented on how hot you are and you smiled, but I got super nervous. As we walked down the tunnel you turned to go to UHN (or so your badge indicated) I went to the university. You were absolutely stunning and I cannot get your smile and body out of my mind! If you see this, maybe we can have lunch?
  
  
 Southbound Subway (Monday Morning)
 
Hey,
I got on the yonge-line south bound Monday morning around 10:30. I was standing near the door and noticed we kept making eye contact. Eventually I sat down across from you and we continued to make eye contact whenever we had the chance. 
You got off at King and I stayed on till Union. 
You had on a shirt with a company logo on it and you were carrying a particular bag - let me know what each of them was so I know it's you. 
Would love to chill sometime.
  
  
 Your green dress this morning...
 
Good morning! 
I saw you walking your dog this morning. Your green dress, that long hair falling on your arms....was the thing that makes my day. I know you are in relationship however I just want to tell you that you are so beautiful! 
Enjoy your day
  
  
 I'll bring the wine next time
 
I saw you yesterday on the subway and couldn't stop thinking about you afterwards. I had a small table with me,we talked about how we love finding great things around this city. And that a glass of wine would complete the commute. You were very cute and seem like a nice woman. Would love to get to know you.
You got off at high park station.
I hope that you'll see this.

 Re. 'M'
 
why feel bad and used for opening up?  was trust betrayed?  sharing a pc of your heart is a gift that is as precious as it is rare.  don't be ashamed.

  
  
 Guiness' Mom
 
You were at Cherry Beach on Monday.   I was there with my brother and my dog.   We chatted for a bit,  should have asked for your number.
  
  
 On my motorcycle behind you
 
I couldn't hear what you were asking me when you leaned out your window and said something to me, I had music playing in my headphones. My bike was the same colour as your SUV, hope you see this, I want to know what you said and tell you I thought you were gorgeous.
  
  
 A bit of random perversion, anyone?
 
You're walking peacefully down the quiet street. Houses on both sides, but little signs of life outside the yellow-illuminated glass that separates the neighbourhood from the passersby. It's calm and relaxing. You glance at time to time at the gardens, the houses. Even then, you are alone.
You continue, mindless and mindful. Another house, its porch alight, catches your eye. And there you spot the first person you've come across on your walk. A sexy bald guy in just his pyjama bottoms. Stroking his big, hard cock.
Want the address

  
  
 TTC 501 - You waved, I nodded yes.
 
TTC - 501 Dundas Street West car.  Around 8:30pm Tuesday, August 16.  You got off at the Queensway. I went North on Roncy.
There was a screaming child.  You smiled, she smiled, I smiled. 
Wanted to say Hi but didn't know how, considering.  You too, I think.  Eye contact was nice.  I got off at next stop and went back but didn't see you. 
It's hard to find a good man, perhaps you are one?
  
  
 To my ex husband
 
I love you so much and to this day miss you terribly.  It is still so hard to believe that we are not together.  I am not angry, or hurt, or bitter in any way. I still believe we are mean't to be, and someway, somehow, it will happen again soon.  When you come back, I promise you, you will be embraced with nothing but support and love and acceptance. I promise with all my heart.  We are often told as children that as long as we have hope, anything is possible. Yet as adults, we so easily give up on our hopes and dreams. Well I won't.  I often fantasize telling our future children how you and I were apart and somehow managed to make it back together.  I also fantisize about how different, how peaceful and how beautiful our second chance will be. Day and night, 24/7 I think about you.  I pray to God that you are okay, and that you will return to me.  Life is too hard without you by my side. So much has changed, and I long to share all these moments with you.  I miss you and love you with all my heart. There will never be another, only you.  Please come back soon.
  
  
 Hey you! The pretty woman! One and only!!!
 
Not sure why I am doing this? Just to tell you that you are the most sexy and hot girl I have ever seen in my life. Too bad that I am married and older than you. You may be an Arab or Persian beauty. We often go down or up on the same elevator and I never got the courage to say Hi or compliment you about your flawless beauty. I just look down so that you may not read my eyes. I admire you always in my thoughts and will always.
Your silent Admirer.

 
your a psychic vampire with nothing inside who thinks that publically insulting me or my current girlfriend makes you cool. you bully people and tell everyone your the victim. people see through you. your not smart enough to pull it off or to notice how everyone sees you.
what is it like to be so empty and frightened inside?
keep it up and you will find yourself alone. you will burn everyone because you think its all about you. its not. your nothing but a sad alcoholic.
  
  
 Asian Dude at Goodlife
 
Today around 5pm saw you working out, Asian dude black shorts and ink on your arm and back. Also saw you leaving the shower stall with your underwear on, as I was sitting in the sauna around 5:30 today.

 Stacey, we talked at Y&E Wed. June 22 8pm
 
Stacey, you were walking south on Yonge then crossed to the East side on your way to meet friends. I stopped you and mentioned I found you attractive - we talked briefly but I might have mis-typed your email. I enjoyed our conversation! If you see this, please get back with contact info :^)
You have nice strawberry blonde hair (very light coloured). I have grey-blond hair, and was wearing jeans and blue polo shirt.
Chris
  
  
 Your name starts with M
 
You made me feel so bad and so used, especially since it's been years since I've opened up to anyone . I thought you were cool! No response necessary, just had to get it off my chest so I can let it go.

 Pisces vs Pisces
 
Why is it so hard to believe that connection that feels so perfect inside? 
Why do you deny yourself the chance to know
Why is it so unbelievable that somebody does care about you
Why won't you allow yourself to find out just how much
I've known you only a short time but the connection we have (had?) is real. I'm scared too letting someone in so close, let's jump bowls together and try. Future distance isn't a problem, our connection will hold.
--
If you think it's you tell me something unique about yourself that we spoke about so I know it's you.
Though you're not in the city now doesn't change what the future may hold for us if we both just stop being afraid.

 Purple Hair Female at Yonge/Bloor Subway Station
 
Time & Place
Monday, August 15
Rush hour, around 5:00pm or shortly thereafter at the Yonge/Bloor Subway Station
While standing on the platform waiting for a westbound train on the Danforth line, we stood next to each other.  You had purple, shoulder-length hair, wearing a dark top, dark pants, and open toe shoes.  I was wearing an orange shirt and jeans.  Once inside the train, you stood near one set of the sliding doors, and  I stood near the opposite set of sliding doors.  I glanced in your direction a few times, but like most people on the subway, riders avoid eye contact and look the other way.  You got off at St. George Station.  Realizing that approaching you to initiate a conversation might be startling to you, I wanted to post on here, if you browse CL from time to time --
Would love to start a conversation.  Would you be up for meeting for a coffee, tea, or another kind of beverage some time?
Cheers!

 Looking for Jennifer who used to frequent Woodbine Casino
 
I'm looking for Jennifer who used to frequent Woodbine Casino a few years ago.  She had blonde hair just past her shoulders, in her late 20's  to early 30's and was on the curvy side.  Used to see her at Woodbine casino almost everyday but haven't seen her in a few years.  Both her and I and a bunch of other regulars used to play the same game on the Game Maker machines.
I am female, my name starts with an S and I have long curly hair.
If you know Jennifer, please let her know I am looking for her.
Thank you

 Cute Black Man in Zara Yorkdale (Boxing Day 2016)
 
I know this is probably a long shot but it's worth a try.
I woke up this morning and I thought about you. I tried to find you before but I wasn't able to.
We ran into each other the beginning of this year (around boxing day 2015) in Zara. 
You're about 6 feet tall (I think but you may have been slightly shorter) with a nice build and deep penetrating eyes. You were also wearing a blue Canada Goose jacket. You were with your son and your neice. Your son was so so cute. He was happy because you had just bought him a video game...and your neice...well she was so so adorable.
You had asked me about my opinion about a shirt. I was actually sitting down outside the change room while my son was trying on clothes.
I liked how you approached me and how we conversed. I was dressed in my Sunday's best and you complimented me. When you looked into my eyes...it was like OMG. 
I know you had tried to ask me for my number but it was awkward because my son had just come out of the dressing room.
I'm that beauriful white girl with long blonde hair, captivating  green eyes and an amazing body.
I don't know why but I've always been very hesitant in dating black men in Toronto. My last relationship was with an African American man in LA. Maybe you can change that.
Wish I could find you...even if it's just to have coffee. ;)

 You were sitting in my seat, Tragically Hip concert
 
When I arrived you were sitting in my seat and we chatted about how you were going to get kicked out. You joked about being chivalrous but I was hoping you weren't ;)
Glad you didn't go back to your seat but unfortunately I never got the chance to talk more with you since we were both enjoying the concert.
Never got your name but would love to know it and chat some more!!

 Street parking 140 borough drive
 
Hello pretty lady,
5pm this evening.
i was passing by when you were getting out of your caravan and smiled at me and you were running towards scarborough town center. For some reason i was waiting at the same spot in my motor bike.
You came back and smiled at me and asked if i where waiting for someone i said YES.
Actually i wasn't waiting for anyone for some reason i had a feeling that i will see you again.
I regret of saying YES instead i should i have said i was waiting for you.....
Anyways if you get to see this message inbox me... looking to meet you again.
You were driving a caravan (not sure if it's black or blue) and wearing short (light cream dress) running towards the town center.
Hope to hear from you soon....

  
  
 What a great brunette!
 
Thank you for having the grace to let me admire you in silence today. It made it a wonderful Monday commute. A voice conducting the TTC train insisted I get aboard in your car because the 'AC' wasn't working in the others. She then told us to move down the train and we eventually ended up sharing a door all the way from Bay to Islington. You made my day and I absolutely adored sharing your spirit. Thank you for being 'mon petit cadeaux'...

 BELL - Sales Associate - Scarborough Town Center
 
Hello,
Long shot but will give it a try. Went up to you last Tuesday to inquire about Bell Prepaid - Voucher & Sim card that I end up buying. It happened that both our hands touched and rubbed twice and all of a sudden felt like there is a spark between us.  Give me a shout if that's the case by letting me know your name. I would know coz I got the receipt from the SIM I bought and from your name plate. Pinoy = Pinoy
I would have reacted on this spark if I'm not alone then...
Give me a shout like I said if you wanna step this up and let's go from there.
Looking forward to hearing from you.

 TTC bloor station northbound today around 5pm
 
Long shot, but we (both Asian) got on at Bloor station today and I couldn't stop looking at you. We kept exchanging glances the whole ride up until we both got off at Finch. You took a quick glance again before you got off the subway but when I got out you were already gone. Wanted to say hi but I was too shy. Hope we can connect again.
  
  
 5pm subway today
 
I doubt you'll see this but you got on at the queen or king stop and stood close to me. You had a grey polo and green pants I think. Dark hair and glasses and I think we kept glancing at each other till I got off at Wellesley. 
If this is you then let me know, and if you can tell me anything about my appearance to prove it.
Hope to hear from you!
  
  
 Goodlife- 137 Yonge Street
 
I hate resorting to this but we always seem to be at the gym around the same time. (Between the times of 9-11:30 usually)
Always wanted to say hi but I'm too shy. I am usually with 
my trainer and you're either with a trainer or on your own. I'm younger than you but have had a crush on you since I started. I don't expect this to work but meh what's there to lose?
  
  
 Your work at LensCrafters in Yorkdale Mall
 
I visited the mall this past Saturday and stopped by the store to look at some glasses. You are so beautiful. You're short with long blonde hair and glasses. The dress you had on hugged every incredible curve of your perfect petite body. It was your smile though that really caught my attention. I'd love to get to know you.

 Thank you to all the ladies
 
I found myself wandering around downtown Toronto today and was taken aback by the level of sexiness that I was faced with. Ladies in sundresses, tight skirts, tank tops, and tight button up dress shirts just blowing my mind. I never realized the ladies of Toronto were so incredibly sexy! Bouncing breasts everywhere and to the young lady who asked me what I was looking at with that cute smile, I am glad you appreciated my honesty.
Thanks for making Monday awesome ladies!
  
  
 I wanted to say you hi
 
I saw you with your two sons at the CN Tower. In addition to your beauty and charming face, I am greatly impressed by your elegant personality. I am very much sure that you come from a very decent family background.
We saw at each other quite a few times while waiting for the elevator. 
I wanted to come close and say hi to you but couldn't do it. I am not sure about you but I was attracted to you. I wish to see you again in my life.
God bless you!!

 To the older lady watching me buying condoms
 
I was the 20 something guy holding two bottles of chardonay in the condom section of the Shoppers on King Street West near the Bell Lightbox. You were the lovely lady in her 50's peering over my shoulder as I made my selection. I was not aware of your presence until the audible gasp when I reached for a box of ribbed magnums. My date did not go exactly as planned; the wine went down ok but I forgot to use the magnums in the heat of the moment and I think I may have gotten the clap. Long story short I still have a dozen condoms left over if you are interested in going out sometime...
  
  
 pretty blonde w/Glasses : St Josephs Hospital
 
You were Registering with the nurse in the Glendel wing , Neurology.
I was the long haired , bearded  guy with the cat tank top . You looked cute ass hell and I wanted to tell you and introduce myself  but I figured it wasn't the best circumstances .
Anyways , you were a  sight for sore eyes xox
  
  
 I need what i do not deserve
 
You continue to haunt me in my dreams
Showing me an endless experience where pleasure and pain become interchangeable ideas
 I do not deserve this, I have nothing, I am nothing of value
 But you hold me  in your gaze, and show me your firm hand
And in my dreams you show me patience 
  Stuggling to breathe as you press every inch of yourself against my face
 Sneaking in gasps of air as you shift your body back and forth
 There is a slight of panic, that is counter balanced by the taste of your sweat
  Because I need this, I want this, even though I do not deserve it
  You pull my hair and force my face against your asshole and I lick it, and eat it with fury
My teeth gently scraping it as I gnash my mouth against you, pulling me away to offer a nneded slap in the face then pushing me back in
You have told me to tell you when  I cannot take anymore, when it hurts too much, when it feels too much
   But I can't
   Because there could never be too much of this
I feel you every night in my sleep
  And every day I walk through the world hoping to finally find you
  So that you can show me . . . And I can belong to you

  
  
 You missed a blond woman in a bright dress on Yonge and Eglinton
 
You walked by and stooped at the stop light, I turned around but kept walking. My heart beating a thousand miles. 
Email me! I want to meet you. :)
  
  
 SNYM we found our love in a hopeless place
 
I find myself looking for your face on my screen, to no purpose other than to just see it, i can't talk to you anymore; passing by you on the street those two occasions made that clear, my body shaking in rage even when your voice is long gone your quick gaze could no longer reach me. 
I was holding on to the pain of loosing you for a year, it was me that opened the cage as you called it  you seemed too unsettled in it, I never thought you would flight right out without looking back or concern of what followed inside. It crumbled, it crushed every bone and with it my spirit But I had one memory to keep me going I knew you would not come back that was certain, probably the only thing that was back in that very dark place  but I had my memory and it was very close to my heart  I've had had love uncomplicated, undemanding love, so love really excited. 
It was when I managed to pull myself out of the rubble when I finally was able to get air in  my lungs  without the action inciting pain , reminding me I had been walking with the dead for far too long that I had been dragged inside a shallow, cave with only one memory repeating as  you had  become my plato's cave. It was after I could finally look in the mirror and not see a broken skull with deep dark black eye sockets that you waltz in for one last act, probably the most terrible long act of cruelty in our play. You called me shallow, concerned only with the mundane yet I remember when I a found you, broken with so much will and so little strength to keep going you borrowed mine and when your only concerns were murder shows and alcohol I lend you my knowledge to navigate to safely to start your path. A path you've become a victor in. And I was proud and was
Joyful but you were always forgetful of your past and people that had lend you a hand  so I tried not to let that notion sink in.
Then you called me feminine and lacking of the virility you needed to find in the one you would love back. You knew I was disarmed against this words and that this accusation was the very cornerstone of deep rooted pain yet you used it to justify your lack of livido for me. And it made sense all those nights all, that time finally made sense.
For the first time I understood I was never the one you wanted for the first time I realized three and a half years pass by and I had not been accepted nor truly loved. 
Needless to say this shattered my memories, you had stolen them like a very skillful thief along with everything else you had taken, but I assume a good thief always comes back to get the most precious gem, hard to resist one last blow to the head of you victim.
So once  again you had me on the ground, bleeding once again you walk pass me to the door. 
Sadness became rage and rage translated to every single person I met I found myself having the same fight over and over with different faces. Yes I am not defined by this marketed hypermasculine society every homosexual has given into, and I'm a lot more than my clothes, one thing was true they could judge me on my clothes as that is all they knew of me, they would be almost excuse to Do so but you didn't have that protection, you had me in the palm of you hand and now I realize you might not even know my favourite, food or colour, my favourite book or designer to be completely honest I don't even think you know my birthday but then again you never even bother to learn how to pronounce my name correctly. 
So here I am 5 years after I first saw your face on my screen for the first time, one and a half years after I open the doors and you left I finally realize I was enough, I am enough feminine clothes and all. I bestowed my love upon someone I believed was worth it and I wasn't wrong, is a shame you wasted three and a half years in someone you felt beneath you, but that is for you to remember next time. 
Today I open the cage yet again, I can no longer harbour rage, I need the space for something more fruitful. I wish you the best. I know you will reach where you want to get. 
I guess I no longer will have to wonder, if you had only loved me half of what you loved your other Mexican boy; I guess I should have taken the lyrics of the first song I kissed you to and realize, we actually did find out love in a hopeless place. 

  
  
 Missing our cups of tea
 
Strangely enough, tea time is definitely something I am missing! You? Is it time for some of that steaming hot brew?
  
  
 Foodie talk at St. Clair West station
 
Your tall friend was going on and on about the nuances of food and sous-vide. I was sitting down, across from you with my friend. I have a trim beard and was wearing a pink t-shirt. I thought you were super cute. I'd like to know more. 
This was last week. 
Let me know how many friends you were with and how many were female so I know it's you.
  
  
 Hanlans beach on Sunday
 
You were with a girlfriend on the beach Sunday with the most wonderful bush possible.
  
  
 You Admin the Home Zone and Drink Ginger drinks
 
We met on Bunz while you were being a verb, and you would post the most bestest content, despite the bunz popo shutting u down for having 2 much fun. At some point, ur mom posted this sick photo of the perfect cream cheese snack, and then h8ers got up in your grill and fate cruelly stole you from me. I thought I'd lost you forever. They were miserable, unending days, the ones I had to spend without you. I tried tagging you in posts (cause you love dramz) and your name would be greyed out. It was the most awful feeling. 
One day, the most incredible thing happened I was walking down College with a buddy of mine, when I look to my left, and there was some rapscallion on his tiny board. Wast it... no... It couldn't be... IT IS! Immediately I shouted out for you, \"HOLD ON. ARE YOU _____ _____\"? Your board slowed down to a halt and after a brief pause you were like, \"Y..yes?\" And then I knew I had gotten the love of my life back, and not only did I get him back, but now I'd found out that he had the body of an Adonis. Ever since, I see you here and there, and my heart still skips a beat. 
ISO ur love, offering my heart.
No garbage couches.
  
  
 Looking to speak to people who've had sex in parks for book project
 
I'm writing a chapter for an upcoming book of essays on queer Toronto. Mine is on public sex in parks. 
I'm looking to speak to LGBTQ people of a diversity in age, gender, etc., about their experience in Toronto parks. Can be totally anonymous and done in person, over the phone, or by email. 
I would like to complete interviews by August 22. Questions I ask will include: why have sex in parks vs. meeting anonymous partners online? What was a specific experience that stands out? Etc.
Note: I'd especially like to speak with people who may be 50 - 80, but any age is welcome.
  
  
 Cute Asian girl at a coffee shop
 
We kept making eye contact and you smiled, I got shy and just starred at my laptop screen. Now I can't stop thinking about you and regret not talking to you. 
Describe me so I know its you. 

  
  
 re: Thinking of You
 
I agree with 88. Ex's cannot be real friends. The friendship will never be what you think it'll be. The only way it could is if kids are involved, and even then, it'll be nearly impossible. 
The OP also needs to be a lot less vague. This is what's frustrating about missed connections - that one post could apply to a hundred thousand different people. Something that hints at who this intended for is better than vague. Actually, reaching out to the guy is better than posting on missed connections.
  
  
 Second Cup at Bloor West Village
 
You're a very cute and sexy guy that works at the Second Cup in Bloor West Village and chats me up sometimes :-)
Not sure if you're just a really nice guy, or if you're slightly 'interested' in me.
I will not say more about you, or about myself, as I'm a regular and don't want the embarrassment of you thinking that I have misinterpreted your good nature (not that I even think you'll see this, but one never knows).
I will say, however, that I think you're super sweet and sexy and...
In the event you see this and reply to this post (HA!), ask me some questions that may start to slowly and correctly reveal each others' identity to one another.
Stay cool, sexy!
  
  
 Melanie
 
You were transporting a big, beautiful plant on the #7 Bathurst bus last week.  We chatted about NY and I took your picture.  Do you remember my name and profession?  Drop a line!
  
  
 chelsy
 
When I first walked in and the greeting from you was heard I was already in ohhhh, didn't know how to react so I just said a funny hi back lol.  I've seen you once before and I was really intrigued, now I know ur not just beautiful but also funny and have a great personality.  Haven't been able to get u off my head and don't think I want to. Even if u don't read this n reply I can't let u just pass by without knowing or trying.  If you do happen to see this and reply back ,let me know where we seen one another and whom I was with.  Cheers
  
  
 re:thinking of you
 
If you both ended on friendly terms sure reach out to the person. But i don't think that's the case as you are stating you don't want to get back together. Which could mean you are the one who called it off. Frankly girls that want to be friends with their exes are selfish people. Not sure if it applies to you. But let the guy live his life if you don't want the same things that he wanted with you. You are being incredibly selfish. Go find other people with different view points. If you treated his feelings like manure why would he want to be friends with you if you did not respect his feelings. This may or may not apply to you . But I think girls that keep ex bfs around are really insecure and make relationships all about them. Just my two cents

 Topless blonde
 
Last week I was working construction and you came out of your apartment onto the porch with no shirt on and stayed there for awhile looking down at us. I thought you were gorgeous. This is a long shot but if you're on here give me a shout :)
  
  
 Steven from New Brunswick
 
Hey it's Tania.  We spoke last night at Belfast Love Public House.
My friends wanted to leave and I didn't find you on the way out to exchange #'s.  I've never done this before, but you seemed like a great guy, contact me if interested!

 Spadina Streetcar Help
 
You were with your friend at King and Spadina around 12:40pm on Sunday August 14th. You asked me how much is the bus fare and if I could show you how to use the new payment system on the new streetcar. The 3 of us got on at the same time and we talked a bit before I had to get off at Dundas. Just want to say you and your friend are smoking hot. I believe you and your friend were in your mid 20s, tan to medium dark skin and in heels. If you happen to find this, let's grab a coffee sometime?
  
  
 no class to a brown gorgeous nerdy lady
 
You're immensely beautiful and you seem like such a sweetheart. I really think you're great. Its too bad I'm not on your level. I'd love to spend time with you, making dumb jokes, enjoying food together, working out maybe, whatever, you know? I am sorry for crossing a boundary. I have my place and I should behave within that capacity because that's how the world works and for all I know you're already with someone. I'm not a bad guy, I'd do anything to make you happy if things were just right between us, but that's only dreaming. I'm damaged goods and don't deserve to be happy with anyone anyway. Love your long hair and smile :) I think I feel my heart growing,

 Thinking about you
 
I've been thinking about you. I don't want to get back romantically but I would like to catch up as friends and see how you are doing. So many things happened since we last been in each other's company and maybe I miss your point of view.
  
  
 Where are you L?
 
Where did you go? I miss your cryptic missed connections postings. Not to worry, i printed off most of your previous posts, including my fav, the 949 days poem. Beautiful.

 Riverdale Pool Changeroom - Sunday Aug 14
 
I left the pool today at the same time as you and your partner/friend (both caucasian, brown haired, mid 20's - early 30's). We were getting changed nearby and were definitely checking eachother out. We smiled at eachother a couple of times and I wish I'd said hi to you two, and taken a longer look. You put put on coral/pink shorts and your partners' were khaki/tan. 
Would be great to connect with one or both of you if there's mutual interest, either at the pool or elsewhere. Can't get the image of you guys changing out of my head ;)
  
  
 Urban Outfitters on Queen
 
To the handsome man who was wearing a teal obey hat that asked me \"what's on sale?\" on June 11th ,I'm so sorry I walked away without asking your name, I'm a bit shy and apparently such a fool.. If you get this msg, would love to grab a coffee with you. Please say yes! :) tell me what you were wearing so I could know it's you.
  
  
 At CC's two sundays ago.
 
I had all the confidence in the world. Then you did a set and I was stupefied. 
I haven't been able to put you out of my head since.
It took three days for me to put what had happened to me into words:
It felt like you were commanding me to be with you.
But maybe thats just my ego.
  
  
 L.P - can I please see you again?
 
I really wish you didn't have to leave early last night. I was a bit aloof, I know.
It's just that I found it hard to look into your eyes and be able to speak at the same time. Your smile made me lose my breath a little too.
Please let me take you out again. 
I promise to be more myself.

 LE GO Train - Friday Afternoon
 
Friday afternoon, the 1:13pm LE GO Train, at Scarborough station. You're so gorgeous! You were wearing an orange summer top and those black ripped shorts OMG. We caught each others eyes for only brief moment before you got off. Shaking my head at not saying hi. Maybe you'll see this and say hi back...
  
  
 Do you resemble Jake Gyllenhaal?
 
Don't judge. It's Sunday...it's hot...and I'm taking a break.
Have you ever wondered who your celebrity crush is? After much thought and deliberation, I'd have to say mine is Jake Gyllenhaal. He's sexy, hot, cute, funny, charming, smart and just all around adorable! I love his looks and his demeanor. So, if anyone out there resembles Mr. G., you need to message me...pronto, because I have this *huge* thing for Jake. If you have a cops uniform, bonus to that! I love End of Watch! :)
Aren't you glad Craigslist exists? Always great for killing time and if you post something, even better because you will have some really nice messages and also troll messages and who doesn't love to troll a troll :) 
My break is over now. Thanks for indulging me.
Have a great day and stay safe!

 Walked by and waved at each other at Spadina and Richmond
 
Hey handsome,
It was Saturday August 13 around 6 pm. I was wearing a grey and teal striped tank top with teal shorts and walking with a friend of mine when you past us. You're white with brown hair and you were wearing mostly black. As you past me and my friend, you and I looked at each other and smiled. Then, when we were past each other, you and I both turned back to see each other again. I waved and you waved back.
If you get this, message me and let's find out more about each other :)
  
  
 I come to your Tims every morning.
 
Hi. You are the cutest server I ever had at Tims. Your name starts with an A. If you think you know who this is, I would love to hear from you. Hope to hear from you soon my daughter. Hope you have a great trip.
  
  
 42 Reasons (to hate you)
 
42: because you made it seem like we be something
41: because you always had little ways of avoiding question
40: because you made me think you were leaving him for so long
39: because you selfishly walked away knowing your game
38: because you acted as if you were immortal then lost your job
37: because you blamed anyone else but you for your mishaps
36: because you spent months trash talking him then went back to him in my face 
35: because you supported me fully until it really mattered and you were gone
34: because you steered your whole 'thing' with me like an evil married woman would do
33: because you spoke like you loved me but treated me like a toy when it suited you best.
32: because you allowed me to fall in love with you
31: because you didn't see where real love lays because your too broken inside as a 37 yr old woman riddled with issues 
30: because you pretend that I was the problem when I'm just that one you came here to find and I had only great intentions
29: because you now call out the 'get lost' lines but I was never to blame but you are you own problem and fail to realize that
28: because you knew I'd love you immensely but you showed me how that sometimes don't cut it among the damaged types.. we'll call ya
27: because when we were together, I felt better than anyone on the planet and you took it all away like nothing
26: because you let yourself meet me, then you let your husband retry with you after you got tired of your open arrangement together
25: because you changed into something else during the spring and you didn't stop the change
24: because you hid your incriminating messages or lies because you knew the game you had to keep playing on me
23: because you broke me down a few times harshly and unnecessarily then came back as an angel like nothing even happened
22: because you came into my life a second time only to set us up for disaster a second time
21: because you told me you were separated when we met and that a plan is in place to get divorced
20: because you only see the wrong I ever said, and refuse to recognize that you were the catalyst in all that happened - all of it 
19: because you became more and more obvious of a tattered soul after offering up the detail that you used to escort with a girlfriend in your York college days
18: because you have this fake Italian act up but when you were broke down you'd finally start to be real
19: because when you called a break I moved on with someone, why did you have to come destroy that momentum? Because selfish.
18: because you acted sweet to me unless in public where you became withdrawn which always confused me
17: because you knew that you know you're only doing this because of your family and what they all invested in your ever-after
16: because you lost 4 corporate jobs, a fiancé, a husband who's convinced you that fat isn't good for him - and you still think you're on point? Like you get to act like this in the world? You're as classic as they come
15: because you only call me when you feel like it and I can't do the same
14: because you walked away from project based opportunities you and I started to kick up together after seeing what we could build together
13: because in any picture I took with you in it you smiled, where as, you have a scowl in wedding photos, pics with him and even selfies because you live unhappy 
12: because you showed me that no matter how perfect it seems in your head - chances are good that it's the complete opposite.
11: for making me live this summer any different than how it was spent in 2015
10: for giving up on the idea of giving you a baby, by me
09: for saying things to me like \"let's go watch your team in Buffalo\" or \"come look at this condo with me\" or \"I'm leaving my husband\"
08: for making me have to get over my one thing I wanted so bad and then lost it without a good reason why
07: for confirming to me that your done so it's okay to post this list and delete all your pictures from my iCloud 
06: for watching your lame, cheesy and uber-pretending husband act like you're the shit to him when he isn't into ssbbw women what-so-ever
05: for forgetting what type of girl he actually likes when outside the bmo tower and then looking in a mirror
04: for never being real and actually have a talk instead of your selfish one sided ways to dodge the real hard issues
02: for failing to see that all the above is clear to see that you had a game plan in mind when you wanted me for your sex toy and a full-in when your husband shies away from you for a few weeks
01: and that you made it easy to come up with 41 reasons why I now hate you. One year ago I was posting 42 reasons why I love you and look at your path of destruction since then!
It's sad it came to this and I'll remember you awhile. I doubt you'll ever come into my life because I think you see your damage and you know that it wouldn't be easy to repair. You're the type to just run and avoid it. You'd never do the unthinkable for me and step up, with that dirty heart of yours. I feel for any man that you might try this again with in the months and years to come from here or Ashley Madison. I just simply wished you got well and came to me and showed me the real value in you, and in loving you. I simply learned a hard way. . ... there is no value in you. Always just be his wife who scores off the internet while he scores at him gym - love that whole openness thin you got going. I hope anyone one reading may feel my pain of such abuse and disregard. Maybe someone has a relatable story to share. Coming out of this, I hope I find the best damn woman from Woodbridge who can take me as I am and I can take her as she is from the get-go! 
LL, go get well.
(I'm mulatto, ladies! In my thirties! They call me handsome!)

  
  
 rain by the tracks
 
I haven't thought about you in awhile and then suddenly the memories are overwhelming again. I was walking by our spot on the tracks when it started raining and I thought about that afternoon after class. Has it been 2 years already since I last saw you?I miss you so much in moments like these and it kills me not knowing what happened. Everyone says I drove you away and that you needed a fresh start but something feels off. I hope you are ok S.P.
  
  
 The Rejection
 
I still wish I had the courage to tell you that the real reason I came to see you was because I had feelings for you, but regardless you chose to ignore me afterwards. Am I not worthy enough of getting a real rejection? Silence is a cruel way to reject someone. I still secretly think of you sometimes...you just really caught my eyes.
  
  
 Pearson airport bar - Friday
 
We met at the airport bar while reading. You were a cute lawyer on the way to a wedding. I regretted not getting your contact info before we separated on the plane. We're both taken but I'd like to be friends.
  
  
 To the gorgeous blonde in Otto's Berlin Doner...
 
You were the gorgeous blue eyed blonde I chatted with while we waited for our doners, Saturday August 13 at around 8ish.
You ordered the veggie take out.
I had the veal/lamb.
We should have dined together!
Next time?
  
  
 Cop, elevator, Blue Jays game!
 
To the cop that was interacting with the little girl in the elevator: That was sweet...asking her if she wanted to be your partner and also asking if she wanted to help you :) Then the family got off the elevator and it was just you, and my friend and I. You swung around, addressed my friend and jokingly asked her if she would be your back up. lol Of course she said yes...good looking, dark hair, nice tat and friendly. Ummmm you kind of made me *gulp* when you asked that. I just softly said \"I'd have your six.\" Dayuuuummm, yes...I *would* have your six!
Nice officer, friendly and down to earth. Nice to see.
Stay safe!
  
  
 Celebrity Sighting at The Eaton Centre ;)
 
This is the second time I've run into you, which sounds absolutely batshit crazy, but it's true. Really awkward, and I swear I'm not a stalker but I live a life of coincidence. You're a low key actor that isn't totally recognizable except for your niche films. The general public doesn't really know you as well so you can walk into a mall and not get recognized. 
When I was working at TIFF 2015 you were about to step into a press conference and you looked my way and smiled because I was staring at you like an insane person and I immediately looked down and pretended to scroll through my phone. Today, I was in line to pay for all the clothes I didn't need and I looked up and you were walking up the fucking stairs and we both look at each other. I'm the guy with the fake blonde hair and was wearing sunglasses indoors because I'm part douche, and part blinded by florescent light. Of course, I'm a total pussy and didn't say shit. No one bothered you while you were browsing and I had plenty opportunity just to say hi and then bye and then leave you the fuck alone. You are built like a fucking warrior, by the way. It's a little unnerving but mostly hott as fuck. 
I don't know why I'm writing on here. I guess because obviously nothing will happen, but the coincidence on my side is just uncanny, as the old people say and I had to share. On your end, I'm just borderline stalker but again, I'm not. 
Anyways, if you happen to read this, have fun in Toronto! Blondes definitely do have more fun ;)
  
  
 Paula My Paula
 
We have been seeing each other a lot in the past two days. Would really love to see your Tattoos. You've seen me trying to peek at them. Maybe at 2 in the morning would be a good time....
  
  
 Still thinking about you
 
Hey J, I hope you are well. I know I'll just get ignored if I contact you so I'm leaving a msg here. I'm sorry what I did to you answer you didn't deserve that. I acted like a pathetic little boy. I was going through a lot when I was seeing you. Please understand. I know we will never be together but I'll be very happy as long as you're happy. Take care J

  
  
 Sweetheart with glasses taking photos
 
You were at the lookout, close to broadview, there was another couple beside us. You were cute, and I would be delighted to meet up for a coffee and to get to know you. If youre interested, shoot a message back. Im not into posting on these websites, but it was worth a shot. ❤️
  
  
 No Frills
 
Damn you, you gorgeous looking man w/ long dreadlocks and tattoos, wearing a black cap, white sleeveless tee and black pants, who just happened to make me freeze and lock into your beautiful silver eyes (were they contacts?) with you for a moment when I entered into the No Frills around 5 pm today.
To partially cross through the same isles...
And to check out with the cashier and leave into the parking lot roughly about he same time, only to have my fam bug me.
Why do you have to be so gorgeous
And why do I have to feel so committed to the man I'm seeing
And why do I have to be so scared about meeting people like you for the first time? X(
The world is such a cruel place, to not have met you first.
Then again, the man I'm involved with is gorgeous too.
You just happened to be REALLY gorgeous.
Now you're just going to run through my mind the next few days...
*LARGE SIGH*
(If you ever do see this post, you can confirm its you by telling me what I was wearing. Thanks.)
  
  
 stupid shuttle busses...
 
We both got on the subway at Kennedy, going downtown. We traded a few glances before we had to get off the train and onto shuttle busses because of some subway problem.  You managed to get on the first shuttle and I had to catch the next one, so alas I never got to talk to you.  Wish I did earlier but I kinda figure pretty girls like you get a lot of unwanted attention and I wouldn't want to be another one of \"those guys\".  
You were wearing blue jeans and a striped t-shirt, nothing fancy but my god you're so pretty.
  
  
 Mother of 3 at Tim Hortons today
 
You ordered some food for yourself and your three children.  Muffins, specifically.  You seemed distracted, and brought your items over to where I was standing.  Waiting for our orders, I tried to make conversation with you, but nothing flavorful came out of it.
Clearly the only conversation that was needed was through the glances that we stole of each other.  In retrospect, I should have segued myself into asking for your number, but I didn't think that was appropriate given the presence of your little ones.
However, I wouldn't mind stealing more glances of you, if the stars align and you happen to stumble across this post.  Let me know if you remember what I was wearing, and I'd be more than happy to share another moment with you.

 Jackie downtown
 
Jackie, we met so briefly at King and Church.  You weren't what I was expecting, and I was taken aback.  Everything about you was so beautiful, so sexy.  Your voice, your smile...  If only I could see you again.

The two of you took turns fucking me and spitroasting me.
Would love to play again.
Let me know where you work(ed) so that I know that it's you.

  
  
 Happy Birthday Kamila!
 
Dearest K, 
It's over a year since I happened to learn of your passing via an online obit and I'm still struggling to wrap my head around the idea that you're no longer around.I look at the couch where you once sat laughing, or the table where you blew out a previous birthday candle,or the bed where I'd find you laying next to me in the morning and wonder how it could be that you've simply stopped existing when you're still such a vivid presence? 
I'm so sorry for being angry with you after you stopped responding to my messages.Of all the possible reasons,it never for a second occurred to me to think that you might have passed. I so wish I could know what happened to you. My heart aches when I imagine the possibilities. I also wish I knew where you're resting so I could bring you flowers and say a few parting words,but I've given up hope that that will ever happen. Please know that if I don't come to see you that it's not because you're forgotten. You're still in my thoughts and I'm very grateful for the time we shared.You were always a joy and a good soul and my life and the world were better for having had you in them.  
Happy Birthday dear one and goodbye. XO

 spilled coffee on passenger on train
 
We sat across from each other on the train in business class.  I spilled coffee all over the girl behind me. Wish I said hi so wanted to give this a shot. If this is you let me me know what I was wearing or doing for the most part of the train. Would love to hear from you.
  
  
 I asked you, \"Who are you?\" August 12/13 outside 421 College street
 
You told me that \"I am who I want to be\" was a cop out answer. You were right. If that were true I wouldn't be posting this desperate attempt to walk back to you and tell you to call your friend later. I know you might never see this and we may never meet again, but I regretted walking away from you the moment I did. Now I know another part of who I am. I am someone who wants a second chance for the opportunity to spend more time with you, and I want for you to feel the same way.
  
  
 funny how life gets you
 
she wanted me to like her
and then when i did...  she told me not to....
that can fuk u up.........  when u have fallen and for  a first time...   I never thought love was real
now im so confused and hate myself
my own arrogance has punished me
even when...
u dont understand it  when it happens
those thoughts consume and surround
it makes u guilty
it makes u..... lost and insane
no doubts to what one feels...  
no one feels it but us
missing a voice
missing a laugh
so im told its just lust
so i guess i will masturbate my thoughts away
or will they grow like an erection everyday

  
  
 Were you assaultes by Uber black car driver at 4am?
 
Thought i saw a col fooling around in their car last night outside my condo
But then it looked odd. She was in the backseat. And stayed in the backseat as they drove off
Fancy black car. Couldn't get the plate. Just didn't look like \" a date\"
Did this happen to anyone you know last night? I really hope not but if it jogs a memory let me know i may have some detail to help

  
  
 Via train to ottawa thursday
 
Perhaps a long shot but worth a try.  You and I were on the 645am train business class to Ottawa. You got off at Kingston. I was taken the moment you sat down.  Wanted to talk to you but I did something totally embarrassing. If this is you and you felt the same  tell me what happened.  Perhaps we can get to know each other and see where things go?
  
  
 Met you on qwikmeet
 
I logged in after three months and saw that you messaged me but when I replied it said you were no longer a member. If you're still looking let me know.

 Tall Ginger Starbucks Barista
 
You served me coffee Thursday afternoon... you're super cute, have a killer smile and amazing courtesy.
I'm not in that neighbourhood often, and you were busy with another customer before I could say \"thank you\"... so hopefully your eyes see this message.

  
  
 You smiled at me on keele
 
We walked sat each other today on keele around  5pm. you were going north towards wait clair and I was walking south. You gave me a big smile as we passed and i think smiled back but i was busy admiring how cute you were and your smoke tok eke back for a sec, didn't expect that :)
I live in the area. lets could meet up some time. I was on my way to my extra job for a few hours, I almost ran back to say hi, but i didn't and I'm kicking my self for not doing it now.
 I was wearing a grey top and camo shorts.

  
  
 Good looking Roofer
 
We drove northbound on the 400 close to each other most of the way to Barrie.  Pulled off at the rest stop and missed ya on the inside.
We exchanged glances for a while.  Would have loved to meet.
Maybe there's a chance you see this and shoot me a message.  
Let me know what work car you were in so I know it's you.
Let's connect.
  
  
 Silver fox
 
Hey sexy. You were a tall handsome dad with grey hair and tattoos. You were wearing navy shorts and a polo. We keep looking at each other and smiling but I was unable to talk to you. I kept walking down queen and you went into a convienient store. 
I was the guy in the grey t shirt. 
If this is you message me with with my description.
  
  
 Northbound Yonge subway ~530 on Thurs - green shirt with sibling
 
Subway was packed. You were wearing a green shirt and denim shorts and were with a younger sibling/cousin. You came and stood next to me at Bloor once there was some space. We got off at the same station. Was there something there or was I imagining things?
Thought you were cute
  
  
 Asian beauty
 
I think you were meeting your dad around 430 pm today.  You were wearing a red dress with animal print I think and sunglasses. You were absolutely stunning. I was sitting down working on my MacBook Laptop.  I wish I had an chance to introduce myself.  I hope I see you there again
  
  
 The Standing Asian Fox from Ezra's
 
I saw you today, with peaches to take home from the store. Wasn't stalking. Promise. And I didn't even look. Wonder if you saw me, though. I think you did. Want to again?
  
  
 Goodlife 137 Yonge This Afternoon
 
Hey hottie!
You were changing in the changeroom about 2;15-2;20 today (Friday). You were at the center lockers and stripped down to hot underwear and white socks and gave me a show. You looked great. You admired yourself in the mirror a bit and then started dressing. I watched and then headed to the steamroom/shower. Wished you'd of joined me. I think you will know who I am. ;)  If you see this what colour/style underwear did you have on??
  
  
 You lost your husband ... we cuddled on your couch
 
You should remember just by the title... thinking of you, and would love to reconnect.
  
  
 Guy who plays guitar and sing in long term care
 
You came by to entertain elderly residents in a long term care where I am that day. You were very kind and a resident said you need something to drink coz its too hot. 
I offered you a coke. You were playing the guitar and singing passionately while staring at me. Not so sure if that was a connection. After you finished I opened the door for you and sat outside for a bit. You said it was too hot and O said yes. We talk for a bit and exchange names but I get too shy to ask you number. You asked me where I am from and asked you where you live. You said you have to go to your next show in a pub after. 
If you happened to see this give me a shout and would like to listen more of your music. 
Let me know where in the city you live so I know its you. 
Crossing my fingers that you will see this.

 Zombies 2 II
 
The gunshot went off.  Then, the retaliation.  Then, silence.  
Everyone on your guard! -Seargent S. Pepper
Man, you can't just stop the party. -Jesus
Day 4
Theodor, I miss you. - Dory
What do you mean?  I'm always with you. -Theodor
Yes, but remember how it was back home? -Dory
Yes, I remember.  I don't know how, but I remember it like it happened to someone else and then I remember it like it is about to happen again.  Did it all happen or was it just one dream after another? - Theodor
I feel like I have spent all my life with you in my dreams. Like you were someone I was going to meet all along.  I'm scared that you will leave and we'll return to being with each other only in dreams.  - Dory
Let's go to sleep.  What if we. Hold on.  What if we are meant to be here for just a short time and then, vanish.  - Theodor
You mean, we have to split up?  Why? - Dory
I mean what if the fighting broke out because of something we did?  Would it go back to how it was?  I think it wouldn't.  - Theodor
It wouldn't and no you are not leaving and neither am I.  - Dory
I love you. -Theodor
I love you too. -Dory
What if we just leave for the woods and ride it out? - Theodor
I'd like to.  I want to.   Its just that. - Dory
Its just what? - Theodor
Dory was getting up. \"Let me show you,\" Dory said with a tear running down and into her hair.  She had a cunning smile concealing some painful worry.  He was sad.  It hadn't occured to either that they has just met a day or more before.  It didn't matter.
As they walked through the plains orange and aglow, it grew more silent.  For all their walking nothing seemed to have tired them.  Then, newspapers covered the sky and Theodor was standing in a factory.  Where there should have been a wall, there was an opening to another place.  Some thing stopped him as he yelled out her name and chased after her.  She could not hear him.  Her every step was deafening as her steps echoed through eternity.
He fell to the gutter and she pulled him back up.  \"Are you okay?\" she asked.  Her eyes were shooting transparently with all of her soul as she offered him her umbrella.  \"Thank you,\" he said and the rain stopped.  \"How was it in the Bahamas?\" he asked.  Then she met him in an infernal stare that would terrify even the most terrifying of creatures.  She took a step forward and unlocked the car beep].
Day 5
I guess we'll be travelling in this one,\" said Dory.  With the passing of that storm she pulled up the hood of the car and checked the oil level.  Everything was good.
They stayed in that car for an age of yore.  Many winters passed and many summers without a word to each other.
Until one day the sun came to set on the past.
Dory was sitting at a cafe on her break where he had just strolled in pushing a baby carriage.  
Excuse me, but have I met you before?\" he asked wondering if he had ever seen her or was it a trick his mind was playing on him.
She didn't answer.\" Dory said.
Hi,\" Theodor said.
I didn't say hi,\" said Dory.
Listen, I'm here.  I found this kid on the beach.  What was I to do.  Leave it?  I can't,\" he was saying in an angry voice.
I think you have me confused faith someone else.\" Dory started to cry.
Its our baby.\" Theodor
I know.  I can't keep running like this.  Its worse everytime.  Just stay here this time, please.\"
Everything keeps changing all the time.  I'll come back for you.  I have to hide the baby.\" Theodor said as her hair fell forward covering her tears.
I'll be right back.\"
He comes back. She waited.  They go together to get baby.  No ones a zombie.  Not yet.
I'm getting hungry,\" said the store manager.  Bang] A sniper got him.
Day 6
Bartender, two shots of whatever is on the house,\" Theodor said.
Listen here, nothing is on the house.  I'll get y'all some water, but that's it,\" said the bartender.  \"This is a robbery, all of your watches and valuables!\" Dory was serious.  With the baby in the stroller no one could have suspected them of this plot.
Yes, it was a plot of plots to be reckoned with.
Day 7
Dory was standing at the far end of the ground floor.  Mozart was playing in a room from an out of tune transistor radio.
He walked to her.  Ages passed and time passed.  He was walking to her.  She was standing at the elevator.  Then, the question remains.  Where did everyone go?  It didn't matter.  
Was it day or night?  It was always the same outside.  Finally, day breaks.
The zombies were shooting each other.  It all ended and began at the same Tim. What was one thing became another in a turn of a minute.  What seemed to be was and wasn't and what wasn't certainly was.  Yet, in all the commotion, nothing happened to the baby.  One thing that was a certainty.
Day 8
Are you injured?\"
We're okay,\" they said in unison.
Where are you going?\"
They said nothing.
Then, the world went black and day light returned, but the .

 Hot Dog Stand
 
Talked with you for a few minutes at the hot dog stand last night about good bars to go to. And douchey bars. Seemed like a cool guy. And you looked sharp
  
  
 Zombies 2
 
The zombies were gone.  At least that iz what they told us on CNO.  Reports were coming in about a necrotized AIDS virus.  The press said it was just starting to learn that they had unconfirmed reports of a project investigating dementia gone awry in a facility for dementia.  Apparently, the nerual-dwelling bacteria did not necrotize tissue postmortem, but instead lead to organ support.
Reports were also coming in of babies being born to zombie women.  The babies were alive and human, albeit with a unique bacterial flora.
We were waiting for confirmation from central command that it was safe to exit the safe zones. 
We were walking through the designated recreation area when a gun shot went off.  Another suicide I guessed.  They were ever more frequent as the undead were being identified. 
Dory, why don't you, with all that fire power, go into the house and see what is going on.  -Theodor
Very well. -Dory
I'll be here when you come back. -Theodor
Alas, Dory came back, but Dory had changed.
Theodor, I want to leave. -Dory
We haven't received word from the news, yet.  Besides, Captain Yvete is guarding at the gate. -Theodor
You don't understand, Theodor, I didn't bring anything to defend myself.  I thought I could instead of shooting, just talk to it. -Dory
I should have gone instead of you. -Theodor
And leave me alone without you? -Dory
Day 1
Dory was standing on the escalator.  Oh what woe it is to be in the spring air.  Aloof and about.  There it was the chiming of the train as the passengers disembarked.  One of them pale, sickly, and approaching her with something about a shadows reach.
Hurry! -Dory
Theodor and Dory start running.  Where are we running? -Dory
You said to hurry.  We're going to the vault. -Theodor
Why there?-Dory
Its the only safe place around.-Theodor
By then the police had already taken over it and were shooting everyone in sight.  No safe passage nor refuge for anyone.
We have to get on a boat and leave.-Theodor
Teddy! -Dory
Dory!-Theodor
The two ran and ran and eventually got on a rowboat.  
Teddy, where are we going?-Dory
Somewhere I don't know where. We just have to stay together. -Theodor
We need to let our families know we are running away. -Dory
Trust me Dory, they are beyond the horizon.  We must go towards the darkness lest we die or worse. -Theodor
No, I won't have any of this nonsense.  You don't mean it. -Dory
You will see once we get there. -Theodor
Arghhh! How could you do this to me! More screaming and slapping]. I love you. Crying]. - Dory
The two exchange looks and with determination for a new life, continue rowing over the freezing cold water, the city behind them burning. Planes overhead were darting every which way. 
Bang bang bang] Identify yourselves. -Coast Guard
The row boat was starting to sink.
That instant the second in command, neutralized his commanding officer.
The order has come to evacuate north!  Are you wounded?!? - Soldier
We are not wounded! - Dory
We are not sick! -Theodor
Soldier, help us! - Dory
The two boarded the boat.
Please make yourselves at home, we have to take to the chopper at 1400. -Soldier
What? -Theodor
Relax, you can handle a 50 calibre machine gun can't you? I'll be right back. -Soldier
I'm going to have to kill him thought Theodor.
Dory was playing with her hair in the mirror.
Hey dude! What's your name? -Dory
Bang bang bang] 
Theodor shot the unnamed soldier.
Well that's great because there was only one bullet left.
Unfortunately there was no warning sticker for the red button.  The automated governance system was activated.  Who would have known that the Commander was being housed on this dingy vessel anyway.  The earth trembled.  The air was glowing dawn red in the west and plum neon in the sky above.  It was as though the world had become a cage.
They found the Chopper in good condition and within a few tries had it flying.  It was in the air.  They were taking it south to the capitol. 
Mr. President, Theodor and I have captured the Commander.  Mr. President?
Does not.  Initiate hide and seek protocol. Abort abort- Mr. President
Theodor, are you seeing this? -Dory
Well, I hear that....
I just saved a bunch of zombies by womp womp womp]. - Dory
Day 3
It was a disco party.  Everyone was dancing.  The pope was handing out franklins and the aristocracy was sipping goose.  The fact that it was raining did not stop the festivities.  There were orgies everywhere.  Some of them, bloodier than others. No one seemed to care.
The world ending was just the beginning of yet another cycle of the changing tide.  There was an Easter bunny adorned man on a trampoline throwing painted eggs at the Eastern delegation.  Ships from all over were docking and the water was sweet and pink.
DJ Jay was playing as the fog machine unleashed spores all over.
Jesus, what are you doing here? -Dory
Hey man, congrats on making it out of witness protection.  -Passerby
Yeah, I was getting tired of selling weed anyway. -Jesus
Yeah, sorry about what happened back at the trial.  - Theodor
Anyway, when are we going to get to see your Dad?
Now. -Jesus

  
  
 Gorgeous black woman in orange dress
 
We passed by each other and exchanged warm smiles in the plaza with Value Village on Victoria Park the morning of August 12th.  I was the tall, clean cut looking white guy.  I was too shy to say anything else.  Would love to meet up with you, it's a long shot but thought I would give this a try.  Let me know what type of clothes I was wearing so I know it's you :)
  
  
 Blonde MILF on TTC
 
You're an older blonde lady that was at Sheppard-Yonge Station this morning (8am). You got on the train heading to Don Mills (I assume that was your stop). You wore jeans and a sleeveless top. I was checking out your tattoos and toned arms.
I was the younger guy with the shaved head who sat next to you and then got off at Leslie station. I wanted to talk but never got the chance (damn, that train moves quickly).
Hit me up :)

You had a colourful full sleeve of tattoos and you were walking behind me. I was in a denim dress, long dark brown hair and had a half sleeve. Should've turned around to make eye contact..

 You smiled at me when I got off at Wilson station
 
I'm not sure what station you got on the subway at, but I turned and noticed you across and a couple seats down from me, legs across the seats infront of you. I thought you were cute and noticed you looked at me a few times too. We both caught each other looking at each other and when I got off at Wilson station, I looked at you when walking down the stairs and you smiled at me... 
Wish you would've said hi, also wish I would've said hi.
If this was you, reply back to this post 😊
  
  
 I miss you...
 
I saw you recently and when I saw your goofy smile, your dark eyes, and your cute face I smiled and felt something I hadn't felt in a very, very long time. I'm not sure what it is, but it's the kind of feeling where you become the only thing in the universe and all I want to do is hear your voice and see you smile more.
When I think about how happy you are, it makes me happy and sad at the same time...
Oh, what I'd give to be the one who could make you smile...

 Goodlife: bass pro cap, blue lululemon
 
although the gym is a bit ghetto the vibe there is pretty decent and so are the people.
Still, like most, I just do my thing because I want to get my workout done and get outta there. I chat up some of the regulars sometimes but keep it to a minimum.
Although ya there are some goodlooking people there no one distracts me except you. And I absolutely hate it.... because I'm not that easily distracted. Yeah, you look good, no you don't have a vibe of being into guys in the least.  But there it is. Typed out loud because I feel I need to just say it -- to someone. Even randoms in the digisphere aha.
You're a total fox and your energy says you're a decent dude. That actually matters just as much in my world.
We functionally speak sometimes, like we did today, but you're def someone I wanna know more. That's all I got, man.
Maybe some day. Maybe some day...

Saw you for the second time, this time you sat near me on the train. You are so handsome, and I really wish I had the nerve to talk to you. You had on a white printed shirt and beige pants today. Tell me what I was wearing!
  
  
 Zombies
 
It starts off in the concrete parking lot of a movie theatre.  Three friends were on their way out when military convoys started arriving.  Men were shouting.  Soldiers were shooting.  Women screaming.  Children were being executed.  All of the school buses were set on fire.  \"Anyone who resists will be thrown over to the enemy!\"  
I beg of you have mercy upon m...\" cried a woman.  More screaming and shouting.  Then, came the horde.  A massive cry of the undead. The children had arisen.  The soldiers died.  The men picked up the weapons and started firing upon the children.  Then, the women started getting attacked as the children overwhlemed them. 
Alas, all of them were dead.
Everyone dies in the end.
Finally, when they were all zombies.  The zombies came to form a homeland.  They took over NASA and created speed of light travel.  Within the next century they had colonized all of the Universe and even found God's homeplanet.  It was inhabited with mutant strippers.
A great war ensued whereupon the president of the zombies kills God and in doing so destroys the fabric of spacetime, making this universe non-existant.
This sparked a domino effect.  One-by-one the universes collapsed.  Fortunately, the one universe where Jesus returns in the year 2000 was still okay.  However, by then Craigslist was banned and all life was on a flat Earth.
That day, Aliceson walked east until she fell off.  The best of our sources have affirmed that she is still floating in space, searching, for new hope.
That year, I started the new hop project.  A team of the best minds on this side of Earth started looking for a way to dig a tunnel out of this side of the Earth and onto the other side.
We succeeded.  There was nothing there.  It was a bunch of rocks in the dark.
Jesus was not pleased with our work and decided that it would be best that Aliceson become the new God.  He searched out Alice and asked her to lead her people to the promised universe.
When they got there, using zombie light speed technology they landed back in a world of volcanoes and rubble, restarting the evolution of man in the time of dinosaurs was disastrous and now there are tyrannosauruses in space suits looking for a place to get a triceratops burger.
The zombie virus resurfaced in the race of dinosaur-human hybrids and they are a very peaceful sort.  They reproduce through spores and it is not yet clear what any of this has to do with anything.
The three of them left the movie theatre together.  The night was hushed down.  The air was humid.  It was just another Tuesday night.  One of them offered to call a cab.  The other two protested.  That is when he came.  Nothing more sinister than a cab driver filling up at the gas station.  That's when things got weird.  At the gas station the shop keeper ran out screaming.  We ran back into the theatre only to find it was empty.  Then the lights went out and then the men arrived.  Fully armed and shooting lasers through the walls. 
They're breaking through!- Screened one of them.  Get the prisoners and use them now! That's an order soldier!
Droves of the undead fell upon defenseless men, women, and children while we just watched from a distance.  We have to do something!- Said the one who had the cell phone.
He called the police, parents, and friends.  No one answered.  Day break set in and the sky was snubbed out with smoke.
Day 1
I don't know what just happened-Steffie said. 
This can't be real. It has to be a joke.- said Ryan.
You saw those bodies!  Are you saying we saw it and it was not real!  Aliceson said.
Stiffie was sure that all they had to do was sit tight and things would be okay.  The rest of the world was another mile away. 
Sooner or later there was bound to be a reconnaissance team or something. 
Day 2
With no hope of the darkness lifting and hunger setting in, Ryan offered to sacrifice himself and run into the KFC and commandeer some dinner.  He went across the parking lot.  Darting in and out of sight between cars.  All of a sudden there was screaming and then nothing.
Stiffie and Aliceson were working on getting a van started and just as the ignition switch started, Ryan came carrying something.  He was covered in blood.  In his arms, the beaten body of a child.
Listen guys said Ryan-this is all there was on the menu.
Day 3
With the headphones on and the cinema door open, they finally decided to give today a shot.  During the night an old man walked in and fell asleep in the aisle of the theatre.  He was wearing full trekking gear and had a hummer.  We couldn't let him see our leftovers from the night before.  Breakfast was quick.
At day break we woke him up.  He explained that he was here on vacation and that he didn't understand why the army ad just blown up all the suburbs.  We were devastated and happy.  Devastated since we wouldn't ever see our friends and happy that we were not discovered in the onslaught.
Wait a sec.-Ryan
What is it, dear? - Said Jim, the theatre tourist.
If what you're saying is true that means everyone is dead, right? -Steffie.
Dude, you remember that movie with the zombies.  What if this is like that.  No, its nothing like that.  Just saying it would be cool if it was. -Ryan said.
Alliceson, you're the only female here possibly in the world.  Its your call.  Do we stay or go?  -Tourist
We go- Aliceson
They got into the hummer.  The car was loaded with fuel, food and water.
Day 4.  The alligator alley highway was packed with cars parked.  They stopped.  They got out of the car.  Then, they made their way on foot on to port sheiza air force base.
Guys there's no one there!  Everything's great but what the hell?!?!- Tourist
Oh, right. -Aliceson.
When will we take a break.  My head hurts.  -Ryan.
Oh my god! Peter!  -Aliceson
Aliceson, there's no one over there can't you... Argh! -Steffie
Why?!?!?!? Stiffie! Nooooooooo. -Aliceson.
Hello Aliceson. -Peter
Peter, I thought you moved to California.  No, Aliceson, I am sorry.
You bastard!  -Ryan
Please relax. - Peter
Relax?! - Tourist
You have some explaining to do. - Aliceson
Who is that over there? -Ryan
Who that? I don't know who that is!-Peter
Ahhhhhh!  What's he doing?!?!!!! Oh my god is he?! - Aliceson
He's just sick I swear.  Now, papa I know his you like company so I brought over some friends from school for dinner! - Peter
No way!   -  Tourist
Wow, he really wrestled down an alligator. - Ryan
Let's just get on with finding another car up ahead where the highway traffic jam clears up.  -Aliceson.
Finally in Fort shizzoma the group of five entered a ghost town.  Devoid of human life.  They found a nice stilted mansion.
Day 5
Sunset
Ryan was sitting on the rooftop waiting to jump when Aliceson approached him in a silk dress. 
You know, Ryan, this wouldn't be the first time I've been.. You know...-Aliceson
Sniffle. - Ryan
Yes, I am aware.  Want some candy coated bonbons? -Aliceson
But I thought we ate them at the movies. -Ryan
I've been saving mine for you.  -Aliceson
I can't. -Ryan
Why? -Aliceson
Listen I just c-Ryan
Really -Aliceson
She stopped his words and they had a cup of tea.
Day 6
My dear boy, would you help a poorvold man. -auditory hallucination. 
I have to help him out thought the old man.  Wait that's me, Ryan where are you?!?!? -Second auditory hallucination.
~You are mine.  You are mine love.  You are mine! Clear away through the aether my life.~
Entering upon that blasted cassete ophone the five broke into an abandoned adult entertainment store.
Oh the filth! - Aliceson said
Aaaa Aaaa Aaaaaaa! - movie on wall-mounted TV.
Guys what are we looking for? -tourist
You got a problem?  What about you, Peter? Fucking faggot! -Ryan
Not that you should care, but I just don't feel good being here. -Peter
I think I know something that might make you feel more comfortable, Peter. -Aliceson
Aliceson, what? -Ryan
Peter, come with me to that viewing booth. -Aliceson
Okay, I think we have a few minutes.  -Peter
Peter, put your pants back on.  Its about your father.  He's always trying to make out with me.  He gets close and tries to bite me and I push him away but he keeps coming back.  Could you please talk to him? -Aliceson
Sure, look I'm sorry about what happened to Steffie.  I know she was close to you.  - Peter
Don't let Ryan push you around like that- Aliceson.
That's when they all decided it was time to leave.  It was late and the entire lot of them were ready to leave for another safe haven.
Day 7
Ryan, how you doing big guy? -Philip
Philip, do I know you? - Ryan
How else would you know my name?! Besides, what is your problem.  You keep looking at me. - Philip
You just woke me up.  Why would I not be looking at you? - Ryan
Aliceson is furious.  Ryan what is it with you?!  - Aliceson
Nothing, what's the matter with you? -Ryan
Listen you two, I have had a really freaky time getting here.  I don't even know how this happened.  No one is even around. -Philip
Yeah, and what is the deal with only one girl here? -Aliceson
You weren't complaining last night, Aliceson.  Isn't that right? -Philip
Aly, you know this guy? - Ryan
I thought we were special, babe. It's just that Philip has something you don't and I can't be with someone that is sleeping with girls like Rachel anymore. - Aliceson
All, you had to do is tell me that you don't love me anymore and I would have left.  Now, you have to berate me in front of everyone.  That's how it has to be.  Then, then then. Ryan died.
Rachel and Kimberly arrived in the wee hours of the morning.  They have a car and an apartment on the outskirts of town on  the bay.  Yesterday they were told to drive south east, but thought it was sinister.  They made it to the midway gathering point on the Junction.
They brought one head of cattle to pull their supereconomy rental car.
We have to be quick.\"
Day 8
To be continued...
  
  
 Union Pearson Express
 
Hey. You sat next to me today coming back from the airport. You had just dropped a friend off and I hadn't just been to a meeting. You wore red shoes, navy shorts, white t-shirt and you were reading a book in Chinese. 
I was a redhead with a beard and I was reading a book too. 
We only spoke briefly, but it'd be nice to see you again!
  
  
 Good looking TTC worker on the Northbound Yonge Line
 
Saw you on the train around 2:30 today before you exited at York Mills. You were wearing a red polo, had sunglasses on and were standing with what looked like a coworker of yours. Noticed you looking over a few times, if I wasn't as shy I'd probably be doing the same back! Just wanted to say mannn are you ever good looking :)
  
  
 Coming out of the vets on Sherbourne
 
You were coming out of the veterinarians on Sherbourne north of Richmond when you said hello to me in a very nice way. I was not expecting that and said hello back but kept walking. You took me off guard as I'm not used to people acknowledging each other in this fair city of ours. My apologies if you found me rude. 
If you see this send me an email. 

  
  
 Guy honking from black CR-V (July)
 
I've come across you twice now in July, same time of week/day, same location, you tap the horn and then drive on while staring, at me it seems.
You drive by too fast for me to confirm if you are who I think you are, and I'm usually too surprised to respond anyway, but your gaze reminds me a lot of a certain person.
If you are who I think you are, and if you actually would like to get in touch, know that I'd be delighted to hear from you, even if it's just to say hello.
Or, if you prefer, perhaps you could reply to this with your initials and the location (nearest intersection) where you saw me, so we can confirm each other's respective identities before any further correspondence.
It's been a while.
  
  
 we met today at York U.
 
We both work at York. We met for the first time. Your smile was electric and your eyes were amazingly piercing - I would love to have them looking at me a LOT. 
You also have amazing feet - even unpainted :)
you're married - so am I - but... I can't help but wonder what would happen if we spent some time together - even though I am older than you. 
who knows universe... ???
Tell me what I was wearing or what business we discussed if you ever se ethis and are interested in lunch ? :)

  
  
 Black Tucson
 
I was passing alongside you this morning. You were in the left lane. We had some glances. Drinks sometime?
  
  
 Aroma cafe bloor/bathurst Tue 7pm- David Beckham lookalike!
 
I briefly walked by you as you were sitting down by the window. We shared a glance and then again before I finally walked out the door. I thought about coming back but I figured the universe will do its job and bring us together if it's meant to be. This is me helping out a little.
  
  
 Une trahison
 
Vous étiez belle et vous croyais qui vous dit.
Je croyais en la bonté de votre âme et je croyais que vous vouliez apporter d'autres légers . Qu'avez-vous dit que j'étais pour vous de choisir \" un glouton pour la punition \" Quelle horreur de vous faire ce que vous avez fait - tout cela . La plupart répréhensible. Une telle une énorme trahison.
J'étais tellement reconnaissante , je fait confiance et avait la foi et qui a été tous jetés en arrière à moi . Je voulais vos mains pour rester ce jour-là . Il y avait un moment où je pense que vous avez décidé de tourner et l'attaque. Vous ne pouviez pas voir que je voulais vous donner tout autant. Il est une boucle , vous projetez , vous répétez la même chose à nouveau . Vous devez obtenir un soulagement initial de faire du mal , mais alors qu'est-ce que vous a laissé avec ? Est-ce que vous guérir ? Voici une idée radicale , que diriez-vous d'avoir des relations harmonieuses .

Dr. O
I think you are so hot
Would love to meet up with you after hours and help you relax. 
After all the patients you see, would love to be able to go down on you and pleasure you...
If you see this.... Please contact
  
  
 TTC-VP
 
Sitting across from you on subway - it was difficult to keep my eyes off your beautiful light-hazel eyes when they met mine on Tuesday evening, you in colourful dress/skirt and brown runners. Definitely a long-shot, I realize, but if you do happen to see this I'd like very much to sit and talk with you sometime.
  
  
 You Kicked Me In The Nuts
 
A while ago downtown I saw you at the club, you were dancing and noticed me checking you out. I thought you were into me too so wasn't sure what was going on when you tried to skip out with your friend, I think you girls were waiting for a ride or a cab when I came out and approached you, I asked for your phone number you giggled and kicked me right in the nuts! By the time I could get up you girls had disappeared.
I know this might sound weird but when you kicked me in the balls I actually liked it? Like I said it might sound a bit odd but wondering if you would ever consider meeting up downtown and booting me in my nuts again, I'll spread em wide this time and let you smash my sack! You could get out some of the built up aggression you so obviously have and I can explore this strange new fetish?  If you see this send me your name, pic and where we were when you left me curled up on the sidewalk.
  
  
 Holiday Monday Aroma coffee
 
Great coffee meeting. You had a unique goatie. It's been a week. Time for another coffee.
  
  
 Chris C. at The Only Sat. July 30th
 
You will probably never see this but I want to at least put it out there just in case someone knows you and shares it with you.
We met at The Only on Saturday night, July 30th. You were wearing a very unique t-shirt (which I commented on), and you were waiting for someone (who hadn't shown up yet), and I was fleeing from someone (already at the bar) and found sanctuary at your table. I was with my girl friend who remained seated at the bar while I was talking to you. I would love to find out what happened after I left and just talk to you some more. I think you're a really special person and wanted you to know that.
If you or someone who knows a Chris with a last name that begins with a \"C\" (I don't want to post it for reasons of privacy) who was at The Only Saturday night of the long weekend (July 30th), please pass this along or contact me - I'd really appreciate it.  I can say that this Chris has no hair on his head and I'm hoping that clue will help without giving too much away.  He also has a married sister.
Thanks so much to everyone who took the time to read this.

 rotate this exchange
 
You work at Rotate This and were wearing a Triage shirt today (Aug 10). I'm in town from Montreal (but didn't mention it). I looked at the Infest record on the wall, you thought I may have been looking at the Bastard one.
You are cute and either way I would like to be your friend.
  
  
 Amazing conversation on the plane tonight
 
We were sitting next to each other on the plane tonight. We spoke for most of the flight. I wanted to tell you how beautiful you were and how amazing your eyes were but couldn't get the courage. Remember I told you I was shy!  I wanted to ask you to join me for a beer and we kind of got separated once off the plane. If you're reading this and you're interested, please reply and tell me where we can meet!

Do you, or someone you know have a story about a successful or unsuccessful experience you had through Missed Connections? Whether it's finding the one, waiting for years for the one, or how optimistic you are when posting, all stories are great.

 St. Mike's Elevator
 
You made a comment about Michael Jordan, and then we had a very brief exchange while exiting.
You are absolutely beautiful with a mesmerizing smile.
I had to get the others I was with home, but would have loved to continue talking.....one day...
  
  
 On the subway...
 
You were on the Bloor-Danforth Line Wednesday afternoon around 3. You are a beautiful blonde and you were standing talking to another woman but I couldn't take my eyes off you. I tried not to stare and forced myself to look away. But I also caught you looking my ways a couple of times. Hoping that's a good thing...
Anyway, if that was you and you're interested in meeting for coffee or something like that, let me know what colour shirt I was wearing or what you were wearing and which direction we were headed.
Hope too hear from you. My heart melted looking at you and I can't get you out of my mind...

 Subway fun
 
You got on I think at Eglington west station and the minute you sat down I was looking at you and you started tugging on your cock. You were looking directly at me while doing it and we both got off at st George and went east, I had work and had to get off the train at bloor.

 you were carrying a bunch of pool noodles yesterday
 
At least it looked like a bunch of pool noodles...
I passed you on Adelaide as you were heading towards Brant st with noodles or whatever they were in hand. Aside from an odd sight you were just adorable. Much shorter than me, very pretty and put a smile on my face.

 St. George to Queen's Park
 
I doubt this will reach you.
Saw you on southbound train between St.George and Queen's Park. You were in Hijab with your friend. We exchanged eye contacts, you got off at Queen's Park. If you read this please send me a message would love to talk.

  
  
 The prettiest blonde on the subway car
 
You stood out from the crowd and knew it. I was flattered that you seem to find a way to stand next to me even as the car emptied and a few nearby seats opened up. You were about 5'5\ mid-20's with long blonde hair that you tousled in the heat. You wore a loose fitting grey belly shirt and a simple chain link bracelet on your left wrist.
I was the 6' handsome dude wearing a navy collared shirt, baseball hat, and nikes. 
I normally try not to give unwanted attention, but I quickly regretted not complimenting you as you walked off the car at Bathurst. I hope you see this and that you'll permit me another chance to say just how stunning you are. 

  
  
 Everleigh Night Club
 
I was at Everleigh nightclub this past Saturday night with a bunch of friends. You were at the bar finishing a drink (slowly) and we got talking. You were there for a bachlorette party and I was there just because it was the weekend. I think you said you were 37 but I noticed that you weren't wearing a ring.
I joked that within 3 minutes of us talking, you mentioned a 3some and your vagina. Interested in chatting some more?

 70 university ave-parking elevator
 
Tall dark and handsome 
I am short of words to describe your awesomeness 
We were taking the elevator to the parking together around 5:30 on 9th August 
You were with someone from work
Seems like you were a traveller with the baggage you were carrying 
I just couldn't take my eyes off you
I guess you noticed that
I wish could take you out for drinks or anything you wish
Keep up the charm 

  
  
 Awesome Beard using Wifi at AGO
 
You were downstairs using your laptop at a bench.
Red T, shorts and a magnificent beard.
I asked you a question then sat at the high table on the other side of the room to use my phone.
I saw you later upstairs with a group of friends.
It would be great to connect with you.

  
  
 CNE Casino Waitress
 
You've got dark hair, dark glasses, a mysterious tattoo, and a smile to die for.

 Woman in the Disturbed shirt working at Torrid
 
I'm looking for a woman looking at Torrid at Scarborough Town Centre, on August 9th at about 8:45pm.
You chatted with my brother-in-law, he was wearing a Disturbed shirt as well. He was into you but he's very shy and I couldn't get him to go back in and ask for your number! I was there with my husband, if you see this, let me know and maybe we (or just you and him) can get together and hang out! :)
  
  
 Waiting for the 36 Westbound
 
J,
We had an interesting talk about what we were doing prior and our school/career endeavors.  Didn't get your number and I'm regretting it already!
If it's you, and you'd like to talk more and catch a movie together this time reply with your name and the school you go to (just so I know it's actually you!)

 The Beaches Boardwalk Sunday 8 Aug 8pm
 
Sunday 8 August 2016 Approx 8pm Toronto Beaches Area Park bench on Boardwalk.
You are sitting in the arms of your man on a park bench along the boardwalk I was walking towards you. You turned, looked at me, we make eye contact, it was electric!!! Fireworks!!!
We both felt it, you smiling so amazing!!! You asked \"Hi, how are you?\" I replied \"Hi, fine thank you\" (or words to that effect) I was so blown away by your beautiful smile, we had a connection...I felt it in my whole body!! 
I could tell you felt it too, you just kept smiling the whole time. Your man felt it too ;) 
I wanted to devour you right there on the spot but kept cool and kept walking. I looked back and you kept that beautiful big smile on your face the whole time. I should have kissed you on your mouth. 
I came back later and you were gone :( I don't live in the area so I have no idea if I will ever see you again. I was wearing sunglasses, a blue dress shirt and white shorts. 
What was my nationality or skin color. I hope I find you. Thank you for making my year! OXOX

Hope we meet again someday.
  
  
 Beaches... like 15 minutes ago
 
I was waiting on the corner and you walked by twice.  I think you thought I was looking to break into your place or something but I was just waiting for a cab.  Anyhooo... if  you wanna contact me... that would be cool.
  
  
 Underground Parking Attendant
 
Just thought you seemed really nice and cool (and cute haha) would love to connect. You knew I was going to the Jays game tonight cause of what I was wearing. I came back up to talk to you and asked you a question, let me know what I asked... If you're interested :) cheers
  
  
 Saw you on the subway on Line 2 westbound
 
You were wearing a black shirt and had a short curly haircut which I thought looked pretty cute on you. I was the one sitting across from you in the train on my way home, you were also on your phone. If you see this or if you swing that way, I think you're pretty hot 
We should grab a coffee sometime :)
  
  
 re: you kicked me in the nuts
 
It was me. I kicked you in the balls and I'm very sorry if I did any damage. I really hope I haven't done any. I realize how delicate testicles actually are and again I apologize for my behaviour. I was coked out of my mind and I really wasn't myself. Just to be clear, I'm not blaming it on the cocaine. I take full responsibility for my actions. But hey,  at least you got something out of it - a brand new fetish. 
To be fair, you didn't ask for my number in the most respectable manner. You grabbed my ass and you whispered rape in my ear and then licked my neck. I'm sorry but that is creepy as fuck. I was legitimately afraid of you. You came on a little too strong and I got spooked. You see, women are like those big industrial photocopiers at offices - you need to take each step slowly and be very patient. You can't just jam 100 pages in the scanner of a document that hasn't been open in twenty years and expect the machine to take it all in. 
You need to dial that shit down. 
Your newly discovered fetish actually reminded me of Rousseau. I just learned that he loved getting spanked by women that reminded him of his mother. He wrote books about it apparently. So yeah, I don't think you're all that weird. Are you a lawyer by any chance? Lawyers get their balls kicked all the time; that might be a thing for you. 
And yeah I don't remember that night all that well so I can't give more details about our encounter. I just remember you doing those creepy things. I remember your eyes. They had this insanity in them. Like the kind you find when you look at photos of Hunter S. Thompson, William S. Burroughs and my personal favourite, Jean Paul Sartre. Dude looks cray. Google him. It will make you laugh. 
Anyway, sorry again about the nut kicking but I was just defending myself. You did whisper rape in my ear.
  
  
 Your Birdcage Tattoo Says \"Live Free\"
 
It was after my workout. On the evening of August 9th, 7:15pm across the street from Air Canada Centre at the intersection of Bremner & York waiting for light to change I turned my head & looked upon the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life. She was tanned, had long brown hair down to middle of her back, was wearing a grey tanktop or sundress, had a patterned jacket or long-sleeved shirt tied around her waist. 
She had a colourful tattoo of a birdcage on her right bicep that had \"Live Free\" written beneath it. She tossed her hair revealing another tattoo on her upper back which looked like a claw mark. Everything about her exuded unforced elegance, joie de vive & a rock 'n\" roll soul. I've thought of little since.
Me - SWM, wavy light brown hair parted to the right with a stubborn geri curl, camouflage tank top, tribal tattoos on left collarbone & right bicep, beat-up jeans & brown tennis shoes, large grey backpack. My jaw dropped and I didn't know what to say as we crossed the street and walked north to Union station. The whole time I pondered an approach & dismissed all not wanting to be skeevy until I turned around & she was gone.
Do you believe in love At first sight? Sometimes you just know. Is there room for me in your life, urban angel? Hit me back.

 A Meeting on Dovercourt
 
We met under unusual circumstances.  I said I lived in the area - you from North York.  I really enjoyed our brief time together.  I'd love to see you again.

 Andrea in 2001
 
We met at Sneaky Dee's one night in the summer of 2001. Hit it off, went home together, and then I lost your number (and my nerve when we ran into each other on the street a while after that). 
Here's the thing: you cross my mind more often than any of my exes! 
Hopefully this exorcises these \"what ever happened tos\"...

You kept checking me out when I bump into my son today at Indigo (Yonge Eglinton Centre). You couldn't stop checking my bulge out. If by any chance you read this. Im looking for you. You have a nice ass. Reply what where the color of my shorts and we can set something up so you can take care of my bulge.
  
  
 ROM - you work there, I asked for directions
 
You work at the camp. I was with my ex 8/8/16. We talked very briefly but my ex thought we were being flirtatious. I didn't even think of it at first... If you like cycling / camping and travel perhaps we should go for tea.
Remind me where I was going or send a picture so I know it is you.
Me, 6', medium build, short hair.
You, petite, long curly hair

 St.George Station Angel
 
To the bright and beautiful girl I saw this evening. Aug 9th at around 1am I was standing on the subway platform at St.George, when we saw eachother. 
You looked a little sad I thought. You got off at Woodbine station. You were blonde, long hair, grey sweater. The entire time sitting on the subway I was dying to say something. 1am on a subway really isn't the time I figured:) 
Im a white dude, about 6'2\". Blue pants and white t-shirt. Two Spanish guys whistled at you when you got off the train. As impossible as this seems, I hope you see this very longest of shots:)
  
  
 dream ;
 
my fucking cautiousness...
its like my mind is like a box, or better yet, a ball, filled with air.
not thinking of anything until the thoughts are actually put into it like air.
but each and everytime i think about something it always seems to be you.
and each and everytime i think about it, im just thinkin of u.
so if you please don't mind, can you stop
because i cant help but deny,
that im not thinkin about us too...
so if u can, can you please tell me what youre thinking about too
because if i cant, then i guess ima lie...
to rather not lie so i can just tell you the truth.
cause my mind's about to set, and i dont want to ever stop thinking about you.
so if youre reading this, please reply, because i need someone besides...
anyone else but besides...

 RBC Bank on Monday
 
This is a long shot but I hope you read this, I was the guy that let you go ahead of me in the RBC bank on college & Ossington,
I wasn't in a rush and I thought you where the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life,
I would really like to take you out to dinner.
  
  
 I love you so much M.D.
 
It's so funny how our relationship started. I don't like you and I don't believe every single word you said but you were so persistent, always there, always trying to get me. Until I fell for you. Our situation is so complicated right now but we both knew that we have each other heart though we can't be together. I love you so much and though you always says that your love is more than mine thats not true. I have grown to love you and I know that eventhough we can't be together right now, if God permits we are going to be in the future. I can't wait to have your child and if that happens I'll be the happiest woman alive.
  
  
 Timing is everything
 
We met a little over a year ago in a far off place. It was the second to last night for both of us. What I began to realize then, and continued to realize for the several months we kept in touch afterward, is that I was falling for you. I know you don't want to talk to me right now, but I think about you constantly. I'm sorry my life is complicated, and hopefully it won't be for much longer, but there's something I want you to know. I will always be here for you because you're incredibly important to me and you own a piece of my heart. Maybe one day we'll get the timing right
  
  
 Super cute brunette wearing blank pants and top at OISE - U of T.
 
Hey,
You were the super cutesy hottie exiting OISE (from the backdoors) to the parking lot earlier this evening around 9 PM-ish. 
You had black dress pants on (I think?) and a dark top.
And your hair was let down!
You are a total hottie! ;-)
If you happen to see this post, then I'd love to hear from you!

 Showers
 
Monday night, approx 5pm.
We showered near each other and showed off to each other a bit. You're young, have a solid body, and have a super thick cut dick. 
My long uncut started to get hard when I knew you were checking me out. But I think you got nervous and went for a swim.
Would be cool to get our cocks hard and line em up side by side to see whos bigger.
Discreet curious guy here. Describe me if its you.

 Endoscopy Clinic Cutie
 
You were accompanying your partner for his procedure. I was sitting across from you in the waiting room. After he was called in I was able to admire you properly and I could see that you were enjoying my attention. 
I think that you're very attractive and I'd like to have an opportunity to nibble on your ear lobe with my lips rather than just my eyes. Contact me and let's make it happen!
  
  
 Hanging Out at the Urinals - 10:30pm Sunday Night
 
Enjoyed checking out the guy beside me at the urinal at the Yonge/Bloor subway station. Wondered if you wanted to make a connection - but wasn't sure due to what I assume was a (monor) disability, as indicated by something tucked under your left arm. 
Doubt you'll see this post, but if you do, send some sort of info so that I know its you - my description, what you had under your left arm, background, body types or whatever. 

  
  
 Boston Pizza Scarborough waitress
 
You were the waitress who served us and we had a great conversation about what your career passions and interests were. 
I was with co-workers and couldn't ask you out, but I felt we had a connection.
Your initials are N.A., and you said you dont work much at BP, more in long term care facility - so I have to resort to this in the off chance you somehow check this. 
If it is you, tell me what our matching pizza descriptions were and how close we live.
  
  
 Beautiful blonde eating a wrap outside of York Lanes
 
You came and sat on the bench next to mine to eat your lunch. You had a blonde ponytail , light coloured dress and sandals. You were completely drop dead gorgeous. 
I was the older guy in the black shirt and jeans. We kind of made eye contact as I left. I actually turned around to come back and say hi but you had already gone. 
If you have a thing for older men on Campus - please reach out to me - I would love to know you.

 Bon Echo Beach
 
Ok this is a long shot but here it goes
2 guys digging a hole in the sand at Bon Echo Beach afternoon of Sunday 08/07 - it was like watching a passage from a romance novel. One guy was then burred in the hole to his head and the other formed a turtle body shape around him. Entertaining to say the least. I was sitting right behind you watching you both and it was super hot. One of you checked me out on your way off the beach. What was I wearing!!

 Richmond Hill Walmart Macdonald
 
Don't know you will see that or not.  We met at Richmond Hill Hwy 7 Walmart Macdonald yesterday morning around 11:30am (Aug 7).  Im with my wife having coffee, You are with a guy and a young little girl.  Im Asian, you are white.   You passed by 2 times and we keep look at each other with passion.  Really want to say hi to you, but feels awkward to do that.
I really want to meet you again for some fun if you go for that.  Or we can meet couple to couple.
Tell me what you wearing, then I know its you.
Hope to hear from you soon.
  
  
 Your warm welcome to the train crowd was a sight for sore eyes
 
Sunday night, you were lounging on the sidelines at the ramp to the great hall while I glanced in your direction and strolled past, loaded with cargo. There you were, alone amongst those chairs, presenting so casually with your knees folded back in fine form...tight mound of your black panties on display for all to see. Sadly I lacked a free hand to tip my hat to you -- I hope you caught my smirk before I slipped from view.
A trainload of people followed afterward, on that very ramp. It was interesting, looking back to witness their reactions. Most seemed to miss your subtle presentation. One man in particular looked down in fervent shame and hastened on. Some glanced. Few stared. Security was oblivious, just around the corner. I wanted to know what was on your pretty mind, all night -- Thank you for such a warm, unspoken welcome home after a long weekend gone...

 asian girl wearing shorts at longos yonge/bloor
 
hey, around 1pm today you were at the longos in the yonge/bloor area.
you're a hot asian girl who was wearing short shorts, and a shirt that all but covered your nipples.. you were skinny.
anyway, you had a backpack and circled around me as much as i circled around you and then you left.
if you were: 
1. interested indeed
2. know how to describe me
3. hot enough for me as i was for you
hit me up!
  
  
 thank you for the view
 
I walked around Bellevue square in Kensington market looking for a spot that would satisfy my needs to people watch, and my more pressing hunger as I held a takeout box.
After one walk around, I resigned my first need to a want and sat down alone, removes from most traffic. This was a blessing in disguise as you were with your mother and settled on a spot not more than five feet away from me so that she could eat her bread. Due to the seating situation you tried hard at first to be modest and lady like, not allowing much to be seen beneath your short white dress. Persistence is key. You perhaps tired or perhaps relinquished in order to forget about withholding and transition into sharing. Slowly i caught more and more glances of your light blueish green panties. At one point it was clear you wanted me to see. I wonder if the angle allowed for you to notice my growing engorged cock. It's open for your viewing pleasure if you would like to continue.
Give me some details
  
  
 Gorgeous Red Haired Mom
 
This is to the gorgeous red haired mom who was sitting on the patio of the club waiting for her kids on Friday, you looked absolutely stunning. 
Our eyes caught a few times, not sure what you were thinking, I think you smiled, but I was thinking how sexy you looked.
If you happen to see this, reply with something you remember about me.
Hope to hear from you.

 Bad timing at the eaton....
 
This is a long shot but you approached me around 4:50pm today around H&M. I would've talked to you longer (I'm in uni) but it was bad timing. If you're still interested (you were cute lol), let me know what you approached me about/why I had to leave.

 Drive-by flirting on College last night...
 
I was riding my bike along College last night. At first I thought it was a coincidence that I kept passing you at every light, but then I realized you were intentionally slowing down so I could catch up with you. When you turned off College - presumably so we could chat - I got flustered and pretended not to notice.
If you see this, tell me the kind of car you were driving?

 Cute twink who flashed his cock
 
You = cute white twink in shorts and wearing backpack, Saturday afternoon. We were stroking very briefly at the urinals and you flashed your cock. A disgusting guy in the stalls let out a huge belch, you winked at me and left. 
I'd love to meet again and either suck you or fuck you. Tell me what I look like and send a pic.
  
  
 Value Village Circling

 Young Lady
 
Hi Young Lady,
I know you will never read this. but to no matter what I try I can't get rid of the ache in my heart. My plan was to give you an engagement ring this December 2016, then we would marry end of 2017/ early 2018.
I didn't tell you because I don't want to disappoint you if I couldn't do it. I've been struggling financially and I have been paying all my debts off as fast I can.  I didn't tell you I love you not because I did not love you,  It was because I afraid I couldn't keep my promise. The stresses of my financial burden and the responsibility of  looking after you really muddied my feelings towards you. The fact is I really do love you. I finally just cleared up most of what I owe.
I know its too late and it doesn't matter anymore, I know you have someone else now. It hurts me a lot. That's why I can't sleep. 
So I think its best if I remove you from Line and Facebook.  Its too painful for me so its best I let go let you be happy.  It hurts me a lot and I haven't been able to sleep since you broke up with me.
Its not your fault.  It was mine.  I should have done many things but I didn't.
I love you.  But its too late.
Good bye young lady,
All the best for your future.
Young boy.

 Shaved head, blue shirt walked past me and two dogs
 
With the advent of online sites is this even used anymore?! 
I was walking my dogs on Isabella street and Church.  You walked past me heading east today around 6:30. I am furry, bearded guy. Said hello. 
Man, are you a handsome one!
  
  
 Guy with broken bike. I hope you see this
 
Three days ago, I saw you with a bicycle of which the beautiful Miele bike frame was broken. If you remember, I striked up a conversation with you and complimented your bike at York Mills subway station at around 2:30ish three days ago (August 4th). 
I got off at Shepard-Yonge station while you were headed somewhere. I hope you see this, and if you do, let's meet up for coffee somewhere!
  
  
 I still look for you in the stars every night...
 
It's hard to swallow knowing that the woman you love with all your heart and soul, the woman who's face you see in every other woman, the woman you wake up/fall asleep thinking of, the woman who still makes your heart race 5 years later doesn't feel the same way about you. Realizing that you aren't constantly running across her mind like she is in yours, is a difficult thing to grasp. It makes it all more difficult when she says she still loves you. 
You give your all to someone hoping that they'll stay forever, but sometimes hope isn't enough, I guess.
She will grow bored of you, she will look elsewhere for a release of excitement, she will suggest taking breaks...yet, you will still forgive and forget, albeit, over and over all in the name of love. When she's vulnerable, you naturally love her more than you ever have as if she was your own child. You will caress her cheeks gently and run your fingers through her hair as she leans against your shoulder. When she's guarded and secure, you will respect her mind and commend her for being a bold woman. You will talk proudly of her, you will encourage her to keep pushing through this thing called life. When she's confused and anxious about everything from careers, finances, daily errands, and even about yourself, you choose to stay by her side and support her with compassion and endearing words vowing to never leave her. When she's lonely, sick, or bored, you will surprise her at work, surprise her with gifts, you will call her to make sure she is loved and wanted, you will massage her void of any sexual advances simply because you want her to be relaxed, and ultimately, you will do everything you possibly can to love her. 
You put aside your own desires for the sake of making this one person 'happy'. You pick up after their every mistake and tell yourself that it'll all be worth it in the end when both of our lives are set. Yet, they won't feel the same - for there is something greater, something more worthy than you 'out there'. She can still be the only girl you've ever kissed and been with, and it won't matter in the end. You ignore every woman making moves at you not because you are loyal, but that you just see every other woman from a gender neutral lens. You only crave one person. You lust for their touch. You yearn for their breath on your neck. You desire their warmth when you are alone. You find yourself the loneliest when you think about how you love someone so much yet you don't feel it reciprocating. You're told every single day that you aren't smart enough, you aren't innovative enough, that you don't have enough money, even though we're the same age going through the same problems. At the same time, I have more money saved than anyone I know in my age group. At the same time I look after my family 24/7. At the same time I stay up until 3am looking for a suitable position on Bay Street. At the same time I'm putting my blood sweat and tears into this one woman. If that's not hard working or an all encompassing person, then what is. 
It's a cliche but they're constantly looking elsewhere to find answers to their insecurities and fears, yet the one who will take a bullet for them is standing right behind them with a bouquet of roses. 
Despite what I just said, I love you with everything in me. Even when we are taking this 'break' or whatever you want to call it, I still can't look at other women. All I think about is you. It's always been you, and it's sad to say, but it will always be like that. I always want to see your face. I always want to give you my input on which dress to buy or which outfit will look good put together. I always want to feed you. I always want to randomly massage your thighs and shoulders. I always want to hold your hands. I always want to write you letters on the 6th of every month (p.s. happy monthly anniversary). I always want to clean your mouth after you've had lunch. I always want to kiss your hands like a queen when we say goodnight. I always want to take you to new restaurants. I want to always go on trips with you. I always want to hear about your day. I always genuinely want to hear about your problems and give you my love and support... I just always want to be there for you. 
At the end of the day, it hurts even more because I know you'll come back and then probably take another break from me. I can't keep being treated like this, it's taken its toll on me mentally and physically. I just want to know whether you actually want me in your life further on. If not, I don't want to keep hoping, I'd rather be alone.
p.s. I bought you those floor seat tix to the concert you always wanted to go to. I'm too much of a coward to message you because I'm afraid you're with someone else again, which is why I say everything here. 

  
  
 Fairtree- striped dress
 
Hello. I was hitting balls beside you today with your mom. Wish I had the guts to introduce myself. Would love to meet up at the range sometime. 

  
  
 Beauty at Ripley's this evening
 
Kept running into you and your friend tonight (you have the lovely ringlets). Smiled a few times, and would have made an intro, but I was with my kids. Might have been awkward (not for them...they're pretty cool). Hope you two had a good evening!
  
  
 Pizza Pizza delivery man
 
You're a young guy I would say 19or 20 Asian. You've delivered my food several times to my house and every time I open the door naked because I'm a nudist  but I don't show u of course. Somehow, I think u know I'm naked because u keep looking at me or at my legs or something. 
I'm the young guy 25 that lives between Jane and Eglinton and Jane and St clair. If you read this, would you like to come in for a beer? 
Tell me my address so I know it's you.
  
  
 LCBO
 
Cute half Asian or Asian 😊
I noticed you have 2 tattoos on the in side of your arm! I could say that I could love you you're so adorable!
  
  
 Alt Girl, Reading on Subway
 
I got on at Coxwell station, you had headphones on and were reading a fantasy novel.
The purple hair, piercings, and your shoes caught my eye. You were adorable.
I never want to disturb people but you had such a fantastic aura about you that I really wanted to know more. 
I was the curly haired guy, reading Perdido Street Station, trying not to stare. 

  
  
 Junction bank
 
Wow I thought  your bank opened at nine :). You were very helpful and seemed like you wanted to talk more or are you just super friendly.   Interested what else did we talk about?
  
  
 Darren
 
Well, it's been awhile and pretty sure you sold your loft.  You weren't sure what you wanted, and you are terrible at talking.  Just wanted to let you know I think about you and  hope you are ok.  For real actually.
  
  
 Your B-Day
 
Your birthday is coming up soon TB
We haven't seen one another since mid March  
Our last minutes together tore me apart watching you leave 
The heaviness was too painful 
I tried my best to hold back the tears 
Had to walk to the end of arrivals to be out of sight 
We had it all and we grew apart 
Time lapsed and we tried again 
Together we work so well as being 1  
What happened to us that last night 
Everyday i longed to see you at my work to surprise me  
To chase me as i chased you
I needed to feel wanted & desired 
Everyday the sadness grew bigger 
My heart grew stronger 
Broken & hurt it still belongs to you no matter what path i walk 
I was the kid in the candy sore with you at my side . 
Only wished you had chased me until you caught me .
Still everyday i wait for the surprise 
At work i  look out my window for that glimpse of hope that you would drive by.
Life would be so much easier if i still didn't love or care for you
  
  
 Tim Hortons . Bye the lake
 
Beautiful ebony women. I couldn't help admiring your beauty. You noticed me looking .you got a bottle of water and walked bye me . I would love to have dinner sometime. That's if you see this . Exact location tim hortons near marine unit.around 4 pm
  
  
 Girl in polka dot dress / glasses listening music
 
I got on at spading station around 3pm saturday aug 6th, stood opposite from you we were both listening to music tapping our fingers to the beat (I was doing some air guitar plucking too :P) 
I found you amazingly attractive and we exchanged some glances, I was wearing a white top, camp shorts and carrying a new keyboard/mouse from Canada computers. 
We boy got off at keele and took the 89, I got off at St clair.
I wish I had said something.
  
  
 High five guy on the set
 
I doubt you will see this and I feel a bit funny doing it but hey. 

You were on set as an extra and I (girl with tattoos) was doing some errands. We high fived and chatted a bit but for some reason I ran away. I think I was so caught up in getting my stuff done that I didn't think to stay longer or ask for your number. I would have loved to chat longer, the whole day that's all I could think about. Really really regretting it.
Crossing my fingers and praying that you might see this and feel the same. Send me a message, let's get a drink :)
  
  
 Maple Leaf Gardens Loblaws
 
We exchanged glances upstairs and spoke briefly in the parking garage - I suppose that I am a grown man behaving oddly, you a young man behaving beautifully. This occurred around 1230 or 1pm today, I became too nervous to speak intelligibly. Please reach out to me, my intentions are good.
  
  
 Beautiful brown princess
 
To the beautiful Indian or Pakistani girl who asked me to walk with her last night.
This is the mixed American guy who invited you to stay but when you had to leave paid your taxi to get you home to Scarborough. I did this because I wanted you home safe.
I also want to be with you.
Tell me the special thing I did for you before the taxi ride... ;-)
And I'll do a lot more for you...

  
  
 beautiful redhead with piercings + tattoos going south from Downsview
 
We talked briefly a few days ago on the subway about the book I was reading. I wish I had begun talking to you sooner, instead of waiting for you to talk to me, but I was overwhelmed by how gorgeous you were and didn't want to put you off by staring. 
We talked only briefly before you got off at the next stop, Spadina. I would love to take you out and talk more. What book was I reading?
  
  
 Guy I used to Massage
 
I gave you a few massages over the last couple years, but the last time you contacted me, I was sick, and then I lost all of my contacts and messages when I got a new phone.  You told me you were moving to a new place also downtown.  Let me know if you want to reconnect :)
  
  
 Porter airport - saw you at lounge, you were accompanied by Violet
 
Saw you at the lounge of Porter airport yesterday. You seemed to be a single mom. An asian girl was sitting across from you. You are curvy and very attractive. I am married and was sitting by your side wearing a blue shirt. Hope we can get in touch.

 Cute girl who worked as a receptionist in Centennial Mornigside
 
I was coming in and out of the room as I had an appointment with the nurses but you kept looking my way and we smiled at each other. I introduced myself but then I got too nervous to ask for your number. This is such a long shot, but I do regret not asking you for your number then. If this is you, hit me up!
  
  
 Just bored
 
You ever just feel like you need someone to talk to cause your married life is so boring and has lost its passion? Well so do I. Just looking to talk to someone in the same position cause well nobody really understands and wants to talk about it. Figured I could be discreet on here.

 Islington - Yonge
 
Last night around 840, you got on the subway at islington statio. Holding a bottle of wine. You sat diagonal from me. Cute guy with the ripped jeans. We made eye contact many times but the subway kept getting busier. Eventually people were blocking us and you had to get off at Yonge.
  
  
 For S
 
S
I doubt you read these but here it goes.
We worked together for a short period of time recently and for many reasons I couldn't tell you or show you whatever was on my mind, this tingly feeling that would take over when you were close, I am sure my eyes betrayed me at times though.
You are younger than me and that is all I can reveal on here. If you think this is you, please tell me something that no one other than you would know.
I miss you :)

  
  
 Alex, my Aries twin.
 
Hey friend, I miss you. Deeply. Remember the conversation we had in march, i unloaded some personal shit on to you and you told me to be moon tzu? I'm sorry i put all of that on you, i know you feel deeply even though you dont want to. but honestly, thank you so much. im free now. im a free bird. and i wish i could celebrate with you. 
please break your rule about keeping me at arm's reach, pull me in closer. only a little bit. too close and there could be seismic activity. i dont want to break anything, just a little fire. a mild burn blister.
i wish you would appear out of nowhere again. tell me about all the great and horrible things you have been up to. i would convince you to meet me for coffee at a park. 
you know how you can always stand on your own, fuck everyone else, until one day you need someone only slightly to help you feel better and you look around and everyone is...gone.
please dont be gone! 
Maybe we just aren't as good of friends as I imagined us to be.
  
  
 Happy Birthday
 
Today was your Birthday. I still love and miss you with all I am. I will always love you! August 5th 1982.
  
  
 My match book, your smile.
 
You brought me out of my shell, Gorgeous, you did.
I was commonplace on my way to the barbershop, enjoying the listen of my recent Jazz purchase of Yusef Lateef, and then you came and sat down next to me. 
If you were anyone else I wouldn't have cared. But you were gorgeous, ARE gorgeous, and I had my life flash before me. 
There was a unique tattoo I noticed. Something in the directional compass idea - on your leg. 
Upon Bathurst station arriving, I asked \"Excuse me Miss\" and you hopped out of my way. 
I stood by the pocket door for several eternities it seemed. 
I glanced at you and you smiled so openly, honestly, I could have melted. I had to look away.
I looked back and had to smile like a goof - only to see you radiating back at me - 
Who Is this beautiful creature?
I am so glad that I did what I did next. I gave you a box of matches from my workplace. 
Come for a drink later tonight\" I said. 
All night at work I imagined what sort of courage I might have expected of a perfect stranger making smiles on the subway...
...I only wish now that I looked deeper into your eyes. 
And perhaps that you may be brave and come to my place of work to see that we are beautiful people just like you, that only wish to facilitate happiness and joy. 
No one can tell, but there may be a future in your kind smile.

 Curvy Manger at Rainbow
 
I saw you for the third time last night while inline for snacks to see the new DC flick.  I was hoping to get you over the other girl who ended up serving me. I first saw you dressed up for the Star ways advance screening and couldn't stop staring.  I even chatted with you briefly about the lost ticket I found.  I look forward to seeing you every time I go and see a new movie and sad when you're not working.  I love every curve on your body and it makes me weak in the knees every time you move your body.  I doubt I have a chance, but like the saying goes, A man can only dream.
  
  
 To the beautiful women i keep bumping into at grocery stores..lol
 
I hope you see this, as awkward as I was, it would be nice to bump into you again.  Your smile is so amazing, and I want to see it again, soon.

  
  
 The saddest feeling in the world
 
The saddest feeling in the world:
Sitting next to my ex-girlfriend who I haven't seen in over half a year... the girl who once loved me more than anyone has ever loved me... The girl I'm secretly still in love with... And it hits me... She's totally over me, has moved on, no longer is in love with me, and questions what she ever really saw in me in the first place... And at that point I remember once she would have married me, and would have been my wife, and would have had a family with me... If I didn't f u c k it up... 
And driving back home, alone, back to my lonely prison of life... A prison of my own creation... A life now forever without the one woman I loved...
The saddest feeling in the world...
I pray no one repeats my grave mistake... Don't take for granted a special love when you have it... never assume you'll ever find it again...
The truth is, time alone does not heal some wounds, and some loves are not replaceable.... 
I love you, and I'm sorry. Please forgive me, and I hope your life is full of joy, peace, and happiness...
  
  
 the gorgeous guy working at square one
 
I saw you while you were doing your customer service work today and I thought - if I had a guy like that in my social circle - it would be so easy for me to work out in the gym and eat salads for lunch. Thanks for inspiring me. I'm not middle eastern but I've always liked middle eastern guys. I don't think its mutual though cause I have small eyes - not gorgeous and big like other middle eastern woman. I'm glad other people don't know my secret cause I don't want the guys I talk to weekly to know I used to crush on them. Your absolutely beautiful! Maybe someday I will find a guy who looks like you that isn't taken.
  
  
 TESSA LAKESHORE AND ISLINGTON
 
Of all the days, i left my phone at home.  We met at one of my friend's houses about 3 weeks ago.  You told me you live near lakeshore and islington and people call you unicorn because of your coloured hair.  I should have got your number or those hints you were throwing.  If you read this then tell me where exactly we met.  Hope to hear from you soon ;)
  
  
 Panda Cellphone Case at Downsview Station
 
We rode the 107 together.  I think you're super cute.  Give me a chance to find out if you're super cute on the inside too?
  
  
 Looking for Sara/Sarah
 
Looking for Sarah.....I use to pick you up at the Esso on Lakeshore and we would go back to my place and chill in the beaches above the hair salon.....I drove a black pickup....I think you joined the Armed Forces  .....we met here on craigslist.....you just popped into my head all of a sudden
  
  
 Sexy mom at Loblaws
 
I saw you going with your daughter today around 4.30pm downstairs. You were amazing beautiful and those short pants were so sexy from behind. I was looking at you like a first time seeing a woman. If you noticed that, please get back to me and tell me more.
  
  
 Handsome Cyclist Scarborough
 
You're a very good looking guy around my age who I've seen cycling around the neighbourhood near Marchington Circle (South of Ellesmere between Pharmacy and Warden). I saw you today (August 5) while I was walking on Ellesmere.
  
  
 Lactating Mom
 
Saw you breastfeeding your baby on the second floor near the food section.
You were breastfeeding from your right breasts and you had your whole breasts out 
without any covering.
You look like a Double D cup, your breasts was large and seem full of milk, and you continued 
to breastfeed from your right breast for almost 1/2 and hour and was still breasts feeding when I left..
You have gorgeous breasts and was hoping that you would switch to your left breasts.
Your full breasts was just out there and no covering.
If you have too much of milk in your breasts I could help empty it.

 Construction Guy Streetcar Downtown
 
This is probably crazy and not sure if people really read this but will give a try...
A few weeks ago, around 5 in the afternoon I was inside the streetcar in downtown Toronto.. The streetcar was packed with people and I was standing up.
I noticed this construction guy coming right behind me.. i was wearing dress pants and you were wearing some jogging pants.. i noticed you stand behind me and start rubbing your crotch against my ass... i didn't do anything but did enjoy that... you look at my face and smiled and then i had to get off...
If you are the construction guy in the streetcar please drop me a line... I would love to keep in touch and maybe meet again.. I live alone downtown and i am open for a fwb where i can give you some bjs after work :)
  
  
 Andres? Queens Park
 
Hey, we met at Queen's Park last weekend. You were the cute shy guy, me... the hung daddy-type. Would love to connect with you.  Gave you my email but never heard back. Your phone was dead.  Anyways, send me a message with description of your ball cap or what you were wearing so I know it was you. ;)
  
  
 Seen you on the 501 zum bus at 12pm
 
You were on the 501 around 12pm and we both got off at the same stop near the theatre. But I didn't say anything. You were wearing army colours pants and had a tank top on with earphones in. I noticed we kept looking at each other. Msg me:)
  
  
 We smiled at each other
 
Friday, August 5 a little after 9am. You were walking outside the terminal with a friend and drinking coffee. Your friend was more casual but you were dressed up and looking fine. I was the blonde in the Jays hat and we smiled at each other. Wish I had the nerve to say hi to you! If you see this please reply and tell me the colour of the suit you were wearing.
  
  
 Grey isnt just a boys name
 
What an incredibly ridiculous assumption. Good luck with living a life where no one touches your junk.
  
  
 Young black gentleman driving uber!
 
This is a long shot.. But I had an uber driver on July 10 named Denmark.. A young black gentleman. I think you were from the west end.
You were completing a ride downtown with me and we spoke briefly.. I really wish I had asked for your number or something but I was so nervous! lol
I don't usually do this, but you were so handsome.. I hope to be in contact with you again :)
  
  
 Bayview Club
 
Hi, I believe you're a contractor who came into the men's locker around 3:30 PM on Thursday, August 4 when I was changing for my shift. Anyhow, I think you might have liked what you saw. I paid attention to you from behind as you were leaving; you're a hulk. You cleaned your shoes before leaving the washroom area. Which company is it?
  
  
 We run into each other at Rose & Crown
 
I have met you and her there a few times over the year
I think we have a connection
Wondering if you wZntbto take this further?
You will know who I am
  
  
 Blonde cutie at OISE - U of T - 5th floor common student lounge area.
 
Hey,
You were the cutesy blonde wearing a green top working on your laptop around 9 PM this evening (Thursday). 
You were seated in the corner facing the elevators. 
Our eyes connected but too bad we didn't! ;-) LOL
If you happen to see this post, then do send me a note! 
Thx

  
  
 HAPPY BIRTHDAY
 
Hope your birthday is full of happiness love and all that life would give you S

 August 4-A+U
 
You had gold curly hair and seemed very sweet. You had pink pants on, which was cool and were riding a legit mountain bike.
You were looking for \"Costi\" (I realise now I lead you in the wrong direction. I apologize). I also didn't know that place was called Costi. A friend had told you to meet her there only five minutes earlier.
I was sitting at the table of the restaurant I work at and tried to help you.
Anyway, I felt like you were nice and I wanted to ask your name, but didn't.
If you want to get a coffee or something drop back at my work or respond to this missed connection.

  
  
 Thu Jul 14 1pm Kipling/Dixon
 
I was driving north on kipling, and you were taking a left.  You're much older but our eyes met, I looked away, it happened a few times. I've never had this happen to me before, just really curious now...
  
  
 Beautiful Hamilton girl in the Distillery District
 
You offered to take a picture of me with the other two people I was with. 
You had beautiful eyes and told me you were from Hamilton. 
Something about you made me want to hang out longer but I had to go.
You've been on my mind since ;) 
If this is you, tell me something about me, what was I doing?
  
  
 C the Hygienist
 
Hey C, you cleaned my teeth this afternoon. I think you are a nice guy with a sweet personality. I know you are attached and so am I, but I think we have a few things in common that could help create a good friendship. If you're interested in adding to your circle of friends, respond with some details of what we talked about. If not, no issue, hopefully see you next cleaning.
Peace
J.
  
  
 for a gorgeous nerdy brown lady
 
your smile, your eyes, your hair, what you do for a living and your silly laugh. I admire and respect you but there's not really anything I can say or do, so I don't bother because what's the point, right? I can work, I can make things better if I ever got the chance but I'll take my chances on my own. not like I had a choice anyway, just getting shut out when  I decided to express myself. I was hammered anyway. I can see that I'm not on your level. I'm not angry about it, I just am aware of my place in society and also...your actions communicate to me more clearly what you think of me rather than what I overheard that one day about equality. you're more educated than I am, you're attractive and can earn more than me with less effort, you're beautiful. I do have a good sense of self worth, I am motivated to do things with my life, I don't see myself as beneath you but I understand the dynamics of things, I do have my strengths and value. I'm really sorry for being harsh on you, but it's just what I do. I create the  distance I need that way.

 Asian girl on eastbound subway, got off at kennedy with me
 
I first noticed you at st.george station fanning yourself with your hand. We got onto the same subway car and headed east, i couldn't keep my eyes off you as your massaged your calves. ahah 
We then both got off at kennedy station and made eye contact at the top of the escalator. You were wearing a dark blue dress, and these cute light blue sandals and purse. Would love to have gotten your number and get to know you. 
It's a long shot but you never know :)

 BMW F650GS rider at The Moto Social
 
Was standing speaking with a middle-aged gentleman when you rolled up on what I'm pretty sure was a burnt orange or red F650GS. We smiled at one another a couple times and I wanted to step over and introduce myself but was kind of stuck... After that I was too chicken, even though I had a couple chances. You met up with friends, I think, and before I knew it you and your bike were gone.
Would have enjoyed chatting about where you rode in from and where you like to ride. :)

 looking for the floor installer i sucked off in empty apartment
 
I met you on here, you replied to my ad. You told me what building to meet you at. I followed someone in the door and came to the apartment you were in. The unit was vacant, and you were putting down floor tiles in there. I sucked your cock while you were sitting on the kitchen counter. 
You were middle eastern looking, spoke very good english, had a nice 6\" cut piece of meat. I dont think I need more of a description, this situation is specific. 
If you read this, let me know what building it was. Id love to do it again or meet you at your next job.

 Hot Older Brown Lady
 
I was driving by and we made eye contact perhaps a coincidence ? 
I didnt have the courage to turn back and say anything because you where older in age and I didnt want to look like a disrespectful person ( I was to much of a pussy to ask). So I am posting on here I know its a shot in the dark but maybe you will respond back. If you do let me know what you color pants you were wearing. 

  
  
 YMCA swimming
 
Tonight we swam in the same line. You were with your hubby. We made eye to eye contact and I smiled at you a little. Drop me a line and tell me whith whom I was? I want to see you again
  
  
 Walking north on Yonge just after 9pm Wednesday
 
This is a one in a million shot, for sure.
I was walking north on the east side of Yonge earlier tonight. It was a nice evening, I had good tunes on, and I wasn't in a hurry. So instead of getting on the subway at Dundas, why not walk up to Bloor?
You must have had the same idea, because we both walked all the way up. We were sidewalk buddies. You were mostly *just* ahead of me.
I'm guessing you were in your 20s. Asian, long hair. Orange one-piece dress that came down just above your knees. Confident. Absolutely captivating.
As for me? White guy, 30s. I can blend into a crowd alright, I suppose.
Now... to weed out the spammers and the scammers that I know inhabit these halls... were you wearing a backpack or not? If so, what colour was it?
It's a big city out there. But maybe we can make it a little smaller.
  
  
 Darren my server tonight
 
You served me and my two friends tonight. You were hot. Would love to have coffee with you. If you remember me tell me my name or who I was with
  
  
 To the woman checking out my torso on bloor
 
I was using my shirt to wipe the sweat off my face and I caught you taking a peek at my body while it was exposed. You shot me quite the seductive look.
I'd be happy to show you more. Name what intersection we were by (bloor and ???) and a little bit of detail.
  
  
 Pizza Nova chick Queen and Coxwell
 
Saw you inside pizza Nova with your friends on Aug 2 2016 as I kept looking at you. 1 of you had a stroller with you. I was the guy with shades standing there waiting for the street car to go west. After I jumped on you came outside to have a smoke. I was outside with a friend or else I would of came in side to say hi. I left a card at the bus stop hoping you would of seen it.

 Hot guy at Joey's Yorkdale tonight
 
We made eye contact as I was coming out of the washroom. We nodded at each other. I think you looked back as I went down the stairs.  You were there with two buddies.  
I know there's like a 0.00001% chance of you reading this but if you do, I just wanna say you're smoking hot!
If you want to grab a beer, reply back and tell me what I was wearing.
  
  
 Handsome Gentleman in Plaid
 
You were existing the train at college when you caught my eye. You are incredibly handsome. I wish I had spoken to you.
  
  
 Cute Asian girl standing and texting outside OISE U of T - last night.
 
Hey, 
Last night (Tuesday) around 11:00 PM or so, you were outside sitting down and working on your MacBook. Then later you were standing and texting away. 
You were incredibly cutesy!!!! :-) I wish I had spoken to you! Haha!
If you happen to see this, then I'd love to hear from you. 
xoxoxo

  
  
 Mark
 
You commented today at work that it looks like I've been working out.  You asked why, hopefully to look like you at 56.
  
  
 Gorgeous pre phd lit.
 
Hey. Talked to you in David's tea today. Was there for work. You were at the table. I almost ironed the bottles into dominoes beside you. I know this is a long shot: we sorta chatted. I wanted to say more but my company is touchy and it's risky. Just wanted to say I thought you were absolutely gorgeous. When you told me what you were studying for I thought that was more than sexy. Well it's a long shot but if you happen to see this id love to get to know you better....

 We Boarded at Bloor (TTC Yonge-University Line / 2pm-ish)
 
Total long shot but here we go. We both got on the Northbound train at Bloor station (yonge-university line) at around 2pm-ish. As we were heading in, we were both eyeing the same seat but I didn't realize until after I sat down (sorry, haha). Anyway, you sat down two seats beside me and placed your bag on the seat that was separating us.
I don't normally pick up on connections in public but I just felt like there was something between us. I tried my best not to look at you (kinda shy) but I swear I could tell you were trying to catch glances at me from time to time. It might have seemed like I wasn't interested in the slightest, but trust me I was thinking about you the entire ride haha. I got off at Sheppard station and you stayed on the train. Tried to sneak in a last look before the doors opened, and I could tell you were too. I just thought you were crazy adorable and I'd love to grab a beer sometime.
If you magically manage to find this post, reply with any details you remember. What I was wearing, what I was doing, what you were doing, etc. Cheers.
  
  
 Zum 501 bus
 
I know this is a long shot 
I saw you get on the 501A bus in Brampton this evening heading towards york university, I thought to myself wow she is beautiful but she's not smiling I hope she does.
I nodded off for a short while and woke up to see you looking right at me with a huge smile on your face, wow a gorgeous smile.
We both got off at york university to catch connecting buses, I saw you jump on a york region bus.
I only wish I'd came over to you on zum bus but never good at first moves :-(
I hope you see this
  
  
 Thank you
 
I got in the subway at Bloor/Yonge and sat right across you. 
It wasn't until we reached Bathurst station when I realised that you were trying to say something to me - I had earphones on listening to music. Took the earbuds out and you said \"everything will be ok.\"  I mouthed \"thank you\" and got off at Dufferin while you stayed inside the subway car. 
I didn't realise that I had tears running down my cheek since I sat down. I've been so numb and sad for a long time that I can't feel myself reacting to my emotions. 
I just wanted to say thank you for the kind words. This city is not so forgiving to people like me and your kind gesture gave me so much hope. Please know that you reached my heart. 

  
  
 You Stepped On My Shoe, And I Was A Jerk
 
As the comical title alludes to, around 4 pm while exiting the Southbound subway at College Station, you stepped on the heel of my shoe. 
I was quite incensed and made it well known by being whiny, and a bit of a jerk. I apologize for that, and I also realize how inconsequential such an event really is - the absurdity is not lost on me.
Wish I'd reacted differently and that I'd addressed how pretty your eyes were once those sunglasses came off, and how disarming your demeanor was while I was unnecessarily annoyed.
Coffee?
  
  
 dancing heavy caribana weekend on college
 
we danced close and good, then i had to leave quickly and didn't even exchange names...
you were with a few friends and sometimes took a break to dance with them before we joined each other again
i doubt you'll find this, but if you do write me and tell me what colour tops we were both wearing. i had a good time and all the best
  
  
 Overwhelmed by all your thoughts......
 
I needed to respond to all you amazing guys who have replied to a post of mine!
I really can't tell you how inspired I am right now. 
I'm ready to tell this guy I drool over and get instantly aroused by.......that maybe we should hook up sometime? Just his smell alone makes me itch for him. I'm super scared to mention anything to him because I do fear rejection and I don't want to ruin the friendship we have. 
Yes, I am very flirty when he is around but not to the point of obvious because I do have a partner (at this point the wrong partner) who is always with me when we are around him. Plus our other friends are there as well. We are never alone together.....except when we meet outside the bathroom......and at that point all I want to do is just grab him and drag him back in bathroom with me.
And there the fantasy would start......without a word I'd put my hand on his crotch.....finding it rock hard and ready for my drippy wet slider. 
Quietly with my fingers to his lips.......I'd unzip him......releasing his phallus to the warmth of my hand. Hopefully he'd crack a slight smile then lean back against the wall, closing his eyes. 
I'd know then he'd want me to stroke it slow at first......then with a little more vigor.....stroking it as hard as it could possibly get. I'd then feel the need to slide down him as to face its girth. I'd spit on it......just to lick it off the tip. Grabbing the back of my head.....he'd press my face forward making me take it all in....all the way down to the back of my throat, as his hair tickled my nose. 
I would be so excited and crazy hot by this point just having his manhood gagging my throat.......I couldn't resist feeling my own wetness dripping with a finger or two. Moaning quietly we'd stare at each other with this new sensual passion.
Looking down at me, his moan ever so quiet would turn to a masculine grunt. Then and only then.....I'd know he's ready from me. Ready for me to hop up on the sink and slide my panties to the side while he spread my very soft legs wide. 
Him leaning forward and me against the mirror, my hand reaches for my clit......I'd wet a few fingers by rubbing my juices around my c*nt. Knowing I'm watching him, he presses against me, pulling me forward and directing his stiff head towards my pussy. 
With one hand he grips my leg holding it slightly up and with the other he finds my clit spreading my juices up and down his shaft......getting me all slippery. Sloppy enough to rub his tip up and down my wetness until my sticky hole sucked it in.
Again I'd have to cover his mouth from admitting the sounds of pleasures. With his head tilted back, c*ck deep within......hands holding back my legs......we'd f*ck......quietly and quickly ensuring maximum pleasure. 
As I watch his smooth phallus pop out, then in, of my sloppy wet hole......I'd push back on his chest and continue to rub my clit......then grabbing for his c*ck......squeezing it as it slides in and out of my warm juices. Stroke after stroke, slide after slide, with our breath laboured, we'd edge closer to that mind blowing release. 
Without a sound and our eyes wide open we become stuck to one another. As the climax comes closer the sound of slurping more defined ........we'd see the end in each others eyes. 
Feeling overwhelmed by excitement it comes......the walls of my c*nt starts to clamp down hard on his c*ck. Squeeze after squeeze, slide in after slide out, my c*nt throbs with an explosion of wet cum. 
Right then with a another grunt he shoots deep inside me, shaking it off as he slumps forward, quietly moaning in my ear. He's relieved.
I wipe the sweat from his forehead as he grabs some toilet paper. Slowly he pulls out, wiping me and him clean. Then with a quick lick to taste our pleasure and a sweet kiss to sharing it, we'd dress quickly so we can return to our friends, completely serviced and mellow! 
I have this overwhelming obsession to be erotically pleased by him and in turn reciprocate the sensual experience.......but not a need to ruin our lives.......so you see I'm stuck but wanting so bad! The next time we see each other I'll remember what you have all said to me and go for it! Or maybe not?
All I know is I need a bath.....lol!
Cheers guys,
Wetnesss

You two are incredible dancers! 
So in-sync. And a naughty flair.

 Cherry Beach - Sex Geek & Awesome Wild Purple Hair
 
OMG you & your wild purple-haired cutie partner are crazy fun! Incredible dancers! You're so in-tune with each other - your connection is so sweet. And not clingy or possessive. It was as if you were having sex on the dance floor but with your clothes on. And it seemed fun & innocent kind of dirty rather than raunchy dirty. Wow. Just wow. Do you teach that?? 
I wanted to join in with my boyfriend, but didn't know how! Maybe you'll see this and we'll figure out a rain-check.

 Ritz-Carleton - Older for younger
 
You: Caucasian hot older exec type with salt-pepper hair. I was the thin toned brown young boy in sexy shorts. You kept checking me out in the change room and the sauna.  You sat next to me in the wet sauna and followed me into the dry sauna where we both got naked.  I wanted to say something but I was too nervous. I went into the lounge area thinking how to approach you.  The attendant called me in for my spa services.  I was hoping you would be there when I came back, but you were gone :(  If you see this, tell me what color(s) shorts was I wearing, I would love to meet you!
  
  
 You caught me
 
You caught me jerking in the park on Saturday morning.  Me: 33, white taking a break from my morning run.  I really didn't think there'd be anyone around that early in the morning on a long weekend!  Thanks for being so cool about it.  I was too mortified to say anything to you, but now that I think back to it, it was kinda hot!  Based on the saucy smile you gave me, I'm thinking you might be open to watching again.  If you are, and if you see this, write back and let's make it happen!

 The person that stood up to my harasser on the Hanlan's ferry.
 
Late Monday afternoon I was taking the ferry to Hanlan's to meet some friends. A man started harassing me and didn't take kindly to my rejection of his advances. No one said or did anything (not even his friend who also didn't look comfortable with it) until he began to throw his arms around me. As we got off the ferry I heard you yell from behind me, \"don't fucking touch her\" repeatedly. He finally stopped. 
I didn't turn around or acknowledge you or him any further because I just wanted to get out of that situation so badly and I didn't have the energy to deal with a spectacle. But thank you for saying something. I've been dealing with sexual harassment on almost a daily basis for over half my life and this was the first time someone has ever said anything. That action meant something not only to me, but all women who are victims of harassment. Thanks whoever you are.
  
  
 Braille method doesnt work
 
Braille method doesn't work if one of us doesn't want it to
I loved every moment being with you and would love more of those, but you don't have time or place for me in your life... no commitments, i get it and I respect it, no matter how much i am in love with you
my doors will be open for you till the second I can get you out of my system... and you made already the few steps to get me closer to this moment
I wish you to be happy and i wish myself the willpower not to text you no matter how badly i want you... you don't want me to be by your side and that's what it is... I get it
and love you

 Subway Delay - eyes
 
We both got on the train southbound from Eglington Station, sat near one another.. Major delay at rosedale then it stopped and went north from Yonge and Bloor. Both got off and ended up getting on same train headed westbound. I got off at st George and before I got off I turned and smiled at you. 
You were gorgeous with amazing eyes.. Hat, ear phones, tats, jean shorts and a black tee. 
What colour dress was I in? 
Hair
Anything else that would describe me 
:) this is along shot..
  
  
 Nurse outside emergency that told me to get stitches
 
On Wednesday evening, I was a guy in a softball jersey with w/ a  cut over my eye and blood all over my face and you were just on your way to work outside emergency.
I walked by and asked you \"in your professional opinion do you think this needs stitches\" ... you answered and said it would probably be a good idea.
Sorry I startled you... but thanks for the advice, turns out I definitely did.
You're adorable, but considering I had a face full of blood I figured that would have been a really weird time to flirt.
I clean up pretty well tho... if you find this, say hi... drinks on me. And you can tell me if they did a good job w/ the stitches. 

  
  
 gentle man
 
That is what I love about u
U r so gentle and supportive
Made me feel safe
U didn't want to hurt anyone
I wish we could talk more

  
  
 RE: Re: St Clair Stroll - m4m (Christie) - m4m (Christie)
 
To the douche who posted this below:
This is BY FAR the creepiest post I've read on here in a while... Let's break it down shall we
-\"You were walking along st Clair - jean shorts I think\"
You probably remember what this person was wearing, let's be honest. People are allowed to just walk down the street minding their own business, as people normally do.
-\"You were cute\"
Well that's nice you think they were cute. I'm sure they were very cute in their jean shorts.
-\"Wasn't sure if you were crusing or just in your own world.\"
Red flag number one. If a person doesn't look like they were cruising they probably weren't. And since this was along a major street and not, say, Church St at 3am, it's probably safe to say they were just walking along the street, thinking of things to buy like cat litter, fresh bread and unsweetened soy milk.
-\"Looked at you but you seemed uninterested\"
Red flag two, and this is a big one. If you look at someone and they don't look interested, leave that person alone. Otherwise it's harassment and just plain creepy. We'll go back to this one in a moment...
Had to run for some errands or would have followed you.\"
Red flag number three. Wow dude. Just wow. If the person \"looked uninterested\" and you \"weren't sure\" if they were cruising, why on earth would you follow them? This is seriously creepy and not acceptable in anyway. This is called being predatory and you need to get a life and a sense of respect for other people and their personal boundaries.
You're a total creep, dude\".
To begin with, who died and made you the judge/jury/moral ground, etc. of CL ads on here? This is a forum where people should be able to express their thoughts about others they've encountered, right or wrong, without fear that a jerk like you will pick apart their ad.
I'd like to state a few things in response:
-When guys cruise, not all of us are obvious about it.  I've been cruised on both discreetly and aggressively so trust me: you can't always tell.  I've also cruised others, and it's worked out quite well, thank you!
-Not everyone who walks along Church Street at 3am is there to cruise.  That's just plain insulting and disrespectful! There could be any number of reasons for people being there at 3am!
-Following someone if they seemed uninterested is a bit much, but the guy who originally posted the ad certainly wasn't trying to come across as scary, creepy, etc.  If that's how you read it that's your problem, not his.
To the original guy who posted, I apologize on behalf of this windbag.
To the guy picking apart the ad - don't let this become habit-forming for you.  Get a life!
  
  
 Travis the trainer
 
You're a trainer at my gym, I don't think you're gay but if you're even a bit interested, you are the type that definitely gets my attention.  We did make friendly eye contact today, here's hoping.  
Tell me what gym it was?

 Veld 2016 security guard
 
you were really something else and i wish i got your number 

craigslist requires that i elaborate!
you were extremely nice - every time my stuff got knocked over you helped me pick it up
you asked if i was ok 
you took care of me a lot
can't forget the jaeger glow stick you saved for me
you called me stunningly gorgeous and i blanked and ran
sorry about that by the way
i can't believe you said that about me while i was dehydrated, sweaty and front row at a rave wearing white glasses and someone's lei 
the entire 7 hours was literally us looking at each other while the other wasnt looking
there was a whole spectacle in front of me complete with lights, deafening music, confetti, streamers, glow sticks, and more but i couldn't stop looking at you
what can i say? i love a shot in the dark

 Bespectacled brunette on Bloor line
 
This seems somewhat akin to tossing the proverbial bottle into the sea, but here goes:
Our eyes locked as you exited a westbound subway train on Sunday.  Two people exchange glances countless times in the bustling city, but those couple of seconds we shared seemed anything but common or shallow or lacking in substance.  And so, stirred from his slumber, the hopeless romantic feels compelled to write these words.
It was this past Sunday heading west on the Blood line, and I'm guessing that the time was around 5:30 in the evening.  You have dark brown hair, glasses with dark frames, and you might seem a little too young for me in some people's eyes.  You left by the front right door, and I would have been seated just to your left as you exited.  It's not a lot of information, I acknowledge, but if you are actually looking here I think you will know.
I'm here.  And I am unable to put you out of my mind.
  
  
 Black girl on brimley
 
You were walking down Brimley heading towards Ellesmere it was around 4:40 in the afternoon on Tuesday August the 2nd  I was the guy in the blue Jetta I looked at you as you looked at me we made a connection i would like to meet up and go for dinner it be my treat don't worry I won't be like the other guys that take their dates to some cheap place I take you to any place you want to go. You were dress all in black actually you are really hot if you see this and want to meet up let me know.
  
  
 hallans point you and your friend anna
 
I hope you and your friends got home safe and you got some sleep. You might not remember but I made sure you got back to them and we had a couple of drinks.
I know who you where with and their names do you remember who I was with and where we met thank for the drinks 
Mike
  
  
 Thanks for the offer......but!
 
I wish I had a more adventurous slutty side to me.....I might have taken you up on your offer! I have a fetish for this one guy who doesn't even know I want him as bad as I do, boo hoo! I'm not here trying to find someone other then him and certainly not a stranger at all. 
I have a hang up that seems to drive me insane and is putting my emotions into a serious frenzy. That's the only reason I'm here!
I want the first time with him to be an outdoor uninhibited hot sexual experience that makes anyone watching to embarrassed that they're spying. I want to be bent over that fallen down tree and f......at first just with his head softly, slowly then holding my hair and all in, super deep and harder until I scream.......so you see your offer isn't safe for me and can't replace the fantasies I already carry around. I have a sensually dirty mind but for the guy I likely can't have!
  
  
 Blonde/glasses cashier at Foodland Beach

 Brandon the running back from fort erie
 
We met online  , probably '05 to '07
We were 17-19. you, a sexy caramel black man with the body of an athlete. Bear like features and so humble about your looks. You took the bus go see me from fort Erie. We met at bay n bloor bus terminal. We found a cheap hotel we could afford in the area where we could talk and get to know each other better. It was ghetto AF but you protected me. It didn't matter where we were. We had each other. We met a few times after that. I even came to watch one of your football games when the Niagara  spears came to Brampton. Remember us on the blow up mattress that had a whole in it? Lol. 
I snuck you into my room. Hid you in the closet and brought us food. 
I think about you still. 10 years later. I remember our last conversation. I should have never been so rude. I should have chosen you.  
I would love to catch up. Hoping this finds you and I hope Ppl mention this missed connections thing to you like they did me. 
I'm tired of getting no results when I look for u. Btwn insta, Facebook, p.o.f and tinder I'm running out of options. You were never a social media head that could remember. 
I miss you.

 Chris C. at The Only Sat. July 30th
 
You will probably never see this but I want to at least put it out there just in case someone knows you and shares it with you.
We met at The Only Bar on Saturday night of the long weekend, July 30th.  You were wearing a very unique t-shirt (which I commented on), and you were waiting for someone (who hadn't shown up yet), and I was fleeing from someone (already at the bar) and found sanctuary at your table.  I was with my girl friend who remained seated at the bar while I was talking to you.  I would love to find out what happened after I left and just talk to you some more.  I think you're a really special person and wanted you to know that.
If you or someone who knows a Chris with a last name that begins with a \"C\" (I don't want to post it for reasons of privacy) who was at The Only on July 30th (which was a Saturday night), please either pass this along to him or contact me - I'd really appreciate it.  This Chris also has no hair on his head - maybe this clue will prove to be helpful - he also has a married sister.
Thanks so much to everyone who took the time to read this.

 Handsome Black Dude with Beard Monday Evening
 
You were crossing your  street a couple time between McDonald and where I was seating ,  Sorry man I could not take away my eyes from you .  I was talking with an old lady ,  You came over and asked a cigaret .
Dam I was shy to say what I  really wanted when you asked me .
I would Love to meet if you are Interested You had black hooded sweater and black sport  pants ..
Let me know 

  
  
 I believe because of you
 
From slain, to defeated, to flourishing
This is where you've taken me
You've been around, and steady; ought not you
I know you're feeling bawdy, but thinking re-purified
I need to hold you--feel your essence kindling our spirits;
Summoning in prescience the synergy of one of the simplest pleasures.
Easy to feel, impossible to understand
But how to capture a ghost?
How to find this infinite connection in lost moments of inspiration?
Will  we see each other?
Will  our hearts contend in promenade and in modesty?
Will  this be the born manifestation of one
Or is as is continued?
I need you, but still I question this situations validity.
It's not a question of sentiment, it's a question of reality
How, when lost at sea, have you appeared once again just before I could hold no more? Are you an illusion? Who's looking out for me besides me?
Like a dream, it's easy to be pulled from chaos in timelessness all dedicated to one final portrait--designed to offer a message. A lesson from experiences and imagination combined away from actuality. And when awoken prematurely, then what? We spend time in reality suspended from resolution until the next sleep; a conclusion lingers upon the day. And then at that perfect moment, this message, this lesson suddenly is real and purposeful.
This is us, I feel. 
Or perhaps just I: dreaming. . . 

  
  
 VIA Rail (I wasn't following you)
 
We were on the 11:02 train from London to Toronto sitting beside each other today (August 1st). We then got on the same subway heading north - but I swear I wasn't following you. Just wanted to put that out there.
  
  
 Beautiful swimmer at DD Summerville pool
 
Monday morning, in between intervals, I chatted with you briefly & described how some elite swimmers use their arms as \"paddles\". I wanted to chat more with you but had to go to work. If I interest you, please email me.
  
  
 Solidary Picnic - Friends of Kensington
 
You were wearing a lot of buttons, and a black shirt with white safety pins on it?
Just wanted to say you looked so awesome and I really would have wanted to talk to you. I just didn't have much time, and also didn't want to be awkward.
Sooooo........ I'll be awkward on craiglists instead. Really hope you don't read this. Nor anyone I know, hopefully.

I want her more. I think about her more. I drip her more. L:ets duel to the death like real men.
  
  
 Mary Curtis Park
 
I saw you today. 
You were really gorgeous. I know it might be impossible for you to see this. You were with 2 of your friends at the splash pad today because they have young kids. You looked awesome. You were wearing a bikini. Please tell me which colour and what time you left to know it's you. I really felt bad that I didn't take your number.
  
  
 Cineplex girl at Suicide Squad event on the Wed.
 
Hello! During the #bellereveTO event in the Suicide Squad exhibit on Wednesday, the first day, I talked to you about the Suicide Squad tickets, I told you I got my ticket for the Thursday first showing in IMAX, you said you weren't even selling Thursday tickets at all. Then we talked about the IMAX format, and different seating arrangements for different theaters, and I recommended the Dundas Square because they put up tickets. I was dressed in all orange, as a Belle Reve prisoner.
If you'd like to watch Suicide Squad with me on a weekend, or another film, I'm up for it if you are, you seemed like a cool person to hang out with!
  
  
 RE: I'm Failling
 
Same here. I want you everytime we meet. You are so cute and so figgity when you talk. 
We need to hook up quietly
  
  
 Met at Belfast- then your place 313 Richmond St E
 
Well this is embarrassing.... We met lastnight at Belfast on King St. I went back to your place and left in a frenzy in the morning. I left my bracelet and an earring at your place which both have sentimental value. I have no other way to contact you and really hope you see this!
  
  
 St Clair Stroll
 
You were walking along st Clair - jean shorts I think.  You were cute.  Wasn't sure if you were crusing or just in your own world.  Looked at you but you seemed uninterested.  Had to run for some errands or would have followed you.

 2 Asians playing Pokemon
 
To the two Asian guys playing Pokemon at the harbour front near the jack Layton terminal. You two are really cute! I dont know if you two are dating or not but I wanted to talk to you guys! If you so happened to read this message me and let's hangout! Message me and let me know what I was sitting on so I know it's you! :)
  
  
 What it was like...
 
Every early morning, he would lay his head upon his pillow. The same inane challenges, hours in solitude, the engines of creation slowly grinding to a halt. He knew there was more to life than this. 
What had changed? Where would he end up? Was simple existence really the only answer? 
Every single night, the same callous thoughts as he struggled to fall asleep.
Then he met her, and saw one like him. Lost in the labyrinth of her own creation, dependent upon pillars atrophied by time. Two hearts torn, through no fault of their own, into lesser parts and base desires.
That evening, he couldn't get her off his mind. Gears turning, as a constant racing through the empty corridors of his mind. Consumed. 
He wore the same thing he wore everyday. Checked his tattooed hands for empty spots and stains of tar. He would be ready for any eventuality, as previous involvement had taught him. It was never too soon, and the very thought made his heart race and mind wander.
He noticed her first. A crooked smile parted his lips. Enthusiastic. Radiant. Captivated. Hers, at least for tonight.
Conversation led to closeness. Closeness to contact. Contact to privacy. Privacy to tenderness. 
He stripped her with the vigor of youth, guided by experience. Entwined, the stroking of hands, lips, and tongue, playing her form like a puppet. Slowly building and finally allowing release, in mutual ecstasy. His. Hers. Delivered in unison.
If he were to remain but a memory, it would be one she never forgot.
(Disclaimer: I am not your intended recipient, this is just an exercise.)
  
  
 Eastbound Kipling to St. George

 matt who listens to matthew good
 
It was 2 years ago. June 2014. You were sitting with your friends in a garage talking to me on Omegle. I just want to let you know i always think about you when i listen to this man and his band, for you introduced me to him. This is really weird but i just wanted to send it out to the universe.

 Indigo Eaton Ctr.
 
Saw you couple of times ar Indigo first near the horror section
Then at the exit , you were with your mom and looked back 
me older with addidas cap you younger reddish hair.
Lets get together
  
  
 Kaja/Kari
 
We met on an online dating site and you had a different profile. We talked every day for a month and expressed what we both thought were our feelings but I believe we both had said things which we knew were impossible to live up to. I ended that online relationship but you found me again. I got to know the real you and liked her even better. We had one short but good date and then I only heard from you once after that. You told me to keep in touch and I have tried but you have not responded. Where have you gone. I just wanted to hang out again and maybe go dancing like you wanted to on our first date. Let me know where we met and what flowers I was going to bring you if you want to meet again.
  
  
 Track & Field Friday- Luke?
 
Can't believe I'm resorting to this but I'd be kicking myself if I didn't try. Had a fun (though very drunken) time with you Friday night and thought you were pretty cool! Wish we would have exchanged info but message me here if you see this (:

I think you live on brookshire saw you today with your son on a bike. I must say you are incredibly beautiful. Not sure if your single but would love to have a drink with you my treat of course.
  
  
 Saturday at Harbourfront-White lace top
 
You were sitting on the stone wall by the marina at Harbour front around 6:30 PM. You had red hair. You wore blue jeans and a white lace top over a black shirt. You had on a beaded necklace and were sitting with an older woman (maybe your mom). You got up and you both went over to talk to a couple you saw then sat back down on the wall before going and watching the drum workshop. 
  I thought you were very pretty and would have told you so if you were alone but didn't want to interrupt. If you remember me and thought anything of me tell me what I was wearing and say hi.
  
  
 I have your umbrella
 
You left your umbrella in my car. If by chance you see this I can drop it back off to you. Idk how much this umbrella means to you but I won't toss it away.

 White v neck at woodys Sunday night
 
You were standing on the sailor side of the bar near the back bar. We were making eyes at each other. I came and shook your hand and we spoke a bit. I said I'd come back to chat with you later but I couldn't find you. Wanted to give you my number. I had an off-white tank top on.
If you're still interested, send me a message. Let me know it's actually you somehow.
  
  
 we kept looking at each other
 
I shouldn't be writing this but I'm sure you won't even see this.. We kept eyeing each other last night at metro....
Thoughts?...
  
  
 I want to tell you I'm still in love with you
 
A message in a bottle for M.B.
But I foolishly write here instead because I have to try to release this or I'll explode... I don't know how to stop loving you. I'm still in love with you. You're still the last think I think about at night and the first thing I think about in the morning... I woke up in tears this morning with a desperate need to tell you I love you.... But I can't... I can't face hearing the cold hard truth from your lips... That you are no longer in love with me... Even after all this time I need to maintain the fantasy that one day we might yet get back together... I can't face the truth that you don't want me anymore, just the thought of that makes my actual physical heart pain, and my body and arms ache terribly even though you shut me out of your life and heart so long ago... So I run and hide from the truth and don't tell you that I'm dying without you, and that nothing and no one can replace you... I run away... And have lost you forever...
This is why I avoid going to a movie with you or going to dinner with you, because even though you seem to agree to do those things with me as friends, I know I'll just ruin the evening by breaking down into tears, telling you I'm still in love with you, and you'll respond with the cold hard truth that I can't face.... So I avoid even just seeing you socially even though I'm desperate to see you...
I don't know what to do.  Im moving to Waterloo in Jan.... Transferd to an office there.  I don't know how to get over the fear of talking to you.... I know you resent me and have moved on... You have been in and out if anothers love.... For all I know you're in love with him still... But I still want another chance with you.  I want to give you the love you deserve.... Maybe I'll tell you after I complete the move to Waterloo in Jan..... But evey single day without you I ache for you... I want you so bad in so many different ways.
But... part of thinks, with tears, I need to face the cold hard truth that I lost my chance with you, that you don't love me anymore, that you're happier being with other guys, and that I need to learn how to move on and let go like you did.... I don't know how you did it, but I'm happy for you that you did, in a way, because at least I know you're no longer hurting this way.
I still love you and I still am in love with you... I don't know how to stop... And even with the news you told me recently, I still want to be with you... So it must be love right?
I know you're fed up with what you thought were empty promises so I'm not going to mention to you if we communicate that I'm moving to Waterloo until the move is complete and I'm there... My hope is you'll be with me again one day....
But if I have lost you forever, please always remember this... If you're ever in a place where you're wondering if anybody in the world really cares about you or really loves you, know this; there is.  I do, and no matter what always will lovely lady.

 Beer Girl At The Toronto FC game
 
I'm looking for the really cute beer girl who worked sections 220 and 221 at last nights TFC game. You have a really cute smile and awesome eyes lashes :) If you see this please drop me a line!
  
  
 Did you ever think . . . . . . .
 
..... \"Hey, that person is looking at me. Kinda cute\"
But then do nothing about it.
And then spend time on here hoping that the person is looking for you?
Why do we do that
Why can we not just get the courage to say something, or do something?
It is a shame. There are millions of us out there who bump into one another day after day, but never really make CONTACT. You know what I mean?
Are you curious? Bored?  contact me.

Hey Erik, You're pretty cute. I don't know if I have a chance with you but if you see this shoot me a message.\"
and by the time I saw it and went to reply you had deleted it. I have no idea who you are but send me a message if you want to get in touch.
  
  
 Yonge line southbound
 
I was sitting in seat with a friend. You were standing with your friend. We exchanged few looks and smile. You were wearing short dress. Wanted to talk to you so bad. You got off so fast at Dundas or College.
  
  
 You waved to me from your BMW to my VW
 
We road raged together exiting the DVP to bloor street Thursday or Friday July 28 or 29. Then you saw me on the DVP leaving the city and you waved! Nice gesture, of course you cut me off too but that was to be expected for my rude behaviour too. Well, you are gorgeous, so contact me!

You were with a lady who compared movie theatre between London and Toronto. If you are the right guy, email me what she was comparing

 I miss our island
 
I miss being with you and feeling your arms around me. Every time I'm with you it's a special memory added to a whole collection of special moments dedicated to us. A month away from you is like an eternity and I long to be with you. I want a lifetime of memories and fantasies shared on our own island that we will build together... You are my everything.

 Black Dress
 
I saw you at the street crossing while I was in a car.  You were wearing a long black dress and I thought you were beautiful. We made eye contact a couple of times as you waited to cross the street at Allen Road and Eglinton West.  I would like to have coffee with you.  If you do see this, please let me know what kind of car I was in. :)
  
  
 You come into my work
 
You come in to my work quite frequently. It's a cafe on queen. You get a decaf latte to go. Today you were with a friend (hopefully). You sat in the cafe and then moved outside. You're so handsome and cute. Let me know what cafe and your name.
  
  
 The brunette at Hoxton last night (Saturday night)
 
Hey, I think you girls were there just by yourselves. You, your blonde girlfriend, and your impressively petite girlfriend. You're the brunette. Me and two of my friends got there pretty late like 1-ish. From then on for most of the night we were basically dancing in the middle of the floor pretty much side by side. I was feeling the connection with you thru our subtle dance moves. You have the sweetest smile, especially when you appeared to be \"live snapchatting your story\" all night long, and seemed genuinely enjoying the time. At one point, you even dropped your iPhone, and I whispered to you, \"it happens.\" I think you are really cute, and I regret not breaking the ice and asking for your name. I'd love to know more about you over a coffee or random stroll in a park. I'm the tall, slim Asian with glasses, and have tattoos on my forearms. I understand this could very well be the longest shot, but I already let it slip once last night, so why not muster up the courage to make a post here!
  
  
 Cute TTC bus Driver
 
I saw you yesterday you were driving the 98c bus and i thought you were super cute. We exchanged looks before I got off at Grantbrook street, send me a pic of you if you see this.

 Baltimore Lips
 
I know you won't see this. I'm happy for you that the Orioles won today (Sunday) I wish I was there with you watching the game - I know you and your friend were in town for all three games. I would even boo Bautista with you! :)

Signed,

 Cute guy watching the Jays game at GoodLife, Liberty Village
 
Cute, blondish guy, sleeveless shirt, working out and back and forth watching the jays game. We chatted at the gym before and you smiled at me while doing cardio. We later shared the abs machine and waved as I left. You're handsome and seem nice. Normal, decent guy here but too shy to ask to hang out. I was wearing a red shirt and have facial hair. Long shot but hope to hear from ya.
  
  
 The Oxley Brunch 1-2:30pm
 
You were having lunch with a girlfriend. I (Blond, curly hair and ripped jeans)was across from you in a party of 3. Drop me a message if you'd like to grab a drink.
  
  
 Just once I'd love to be a missed connection here
 
Most, not all, are so very adorable (boy meets girl or vice versa) or romantically tragic (a love unrequited). 
It's romantic nonetheless and, if I had a magic wand, I would wave it all over the GTA and make all the authentic wishful missed connection posts come true! 💫
How brave and hopeful people are to write here to express their thoughts on their missed connection. 
Maybe I had one or two but they didn't know about this section in CL or lost the courage. (This is what I tell myself) Or maybe I missed them. I can only imagine how flattering it would be for someone in a city as big as ours to take notice of someone. 
If anyone has connected with their missed connection I'd love to hear about it. Even if it was good, bad or indifferent. 
For those who do write about a missed connection, don't you wish you had taken advantage of that opportunity and somehow made a connection and exchanged phone numbers? Do you now make more of an effort to make connections instead of having missed connections?
Although the Celestine Prophecy was fictional but I found some of the \"insights\ for lack of a better word, insightful! Coincidences are not accidents. It's life giving you hints - that the person who caught your attention may, knowingly or unknowingly, have information for you or has a reason for catching your attention at that moment in time. It's certainly an interesting thought. Since reading the book I have gone up to complete strangers to tell them they remind me of someone I know. In most instances, the encounters were interesting to say the least and some were actually helpful. 
Hopeful Romantic
Update: Thank you to the many people who did reply and shared their missed connection stories. Some had happy endings, some were short lived and fizzled out and some sadly did not work out.  Some replied to me to say that they also wrote on and checked the missed connection section at some interval. But all respondanta had the hope and courage I certainly envy! 😍
  
  
 Looking for Morning Sky Mia
 
We saw each other often a few years ago while I was living in Brampton and you split your time between Toronto and Mississauga.
I think about you and miss our times together. I would love to reconnect....

 Saturday Night Club
 
You worked at the club I attend. Before it got crowded we had a good conversation. We both are from different cultural backgrounds, but we found alot in common.
Tell me what club, what I look like and what we discussed. Hopefully we can link up if the vibe is right.
  
  
 O M G ... So in the end it's true...
 
OMG... I've never wanted to believe it... 
But it looks like in the end because of your life, and your ongoing decisions, and your continued choices, and your future life trajectory, I must reluctantly acquiesce and give in to the fact that what \"they\" have been saying all this time is true...
People don't change... You'll never really change...
There is a sense in which our lives are on a path and we're not as free as we think to change it... It almost seems it was inevitable you would end up exactly where you are right now.... Like everyone else living that way in those circumstances...
Our past behavior and lifestyle is a clear predictor of our future choices and life experiences... It's almost like the ever reoccurring patterns from your past led you to this very spot your in, regardless of whether you wanted it or not consciously...
I hate that these things are true... I sincerely do not want them to be true, because it scares the hell out of me, and depresses me re: this life we are all living... but, nevertheless, you have proven these things to be true to me.
Looks like Mr. Smith had it right all along.... 

  
  
 How was it a good idea to turn your back on me and leave me?
 
Im not being conceited or self-centered... but after finding out what's going on in your life and what's happened to you, in a very practical sense, I just don't understand how where you ended up now, is better than  what you had with me?  I don't understand how you can think leaving me was a good idea when you've just ended up in a worse place.
I don't understand.
  
  
 Saturday - Jays Game - Orioles
 
You sat in front of me and to the left 2 seats over. You booed when Bautista would come up to bat.
Everytime you turned your head and I could see your profile I couldn't take my eyes off you. You were with your friend - you are both from Balitmore. (This is obvious but I also over heard you talking to the guy beside you)
I just wanted to say, you have the most beautiful mouth and lips. They are perfect! I'm older than you. You are probably early 30's? Who knows maybe late 20's? I wasn't even watching the game. Your lips, your mouth. So sexy.  
I know you'll never see this...
Signed,
Bad Mom
  
  
 Guy walking sheepdog
 
You were walking your sheepdog in the park awhile ago, and you were wearing grey shorts, a black baseball cap with a red stripe....very good looking, with a little paunch. You said hello. Coffee?
  
  
 Re: Re: Weigh Station
 
the hypocrisy of what you just said is astounding. here you are taunting me and you don't even have the balls to message me privately.
  
  
 Equinox Yorkville-5.45 Steamroom
 
To the hot guy in the steam room. We were in their with an older guy. We had eye contact as we have before always in the change room also you looked at me when you were going to your locker. I'm 40s, fit today grey shirts blue tank top. You compression long tights and black shorts with a long sleeve blue shirt. I have a hard time approaching any guy plus your probably straight but you know I like you cause I always check you out both on the weight room floor and in the change room and seems we usually hit the shower at the same time. I will get right to the point. Would you like to grab a beer or a coffee? Would love to know how you got that beautiful body of yours..plus I'd be into getting to know you on another level if you have any interest and you probably won't see this but if you do I think your incredibly hot and well you do it for me..
  
  
 Used to...
 
Met a girl via cl posting but lost contact. I picked her up from her work then we hung out smoked 420 and ate some food. She fell for me with just a few more meets and told her we couldn't hang out anymore. I didn't want to really break her heart.
I just want to meet someone with no intention of becoming more than friends. I always enjoyed meeting new people. It's very interesting to me to hear about them and who they are. 
Male or female, it does not matter. Strictly nothing sexual!
  
  
 Re: weigh station
 
Very hypocritical of you to make a post saying someone doesn't have courage to talk to another
face to face when you don't have the courage to do it yourself.
So you come here make a vague post about this and think you're talking to this person.
You must be a sociopath as well as hypocritical take your own advice and grow the fuck up.
  
  
 Weigh Station
 
You were right. You are a weigh station toward someone better. 
You do it to yourself because you go out with women who have zero self confidence. And then you come along like a fucking pixie fairy and you give them some. Of course they will go on toward someone better because they all quickly realize that they deserve someone better than you. You're a manchild, a hopeless romantic and a sociopath. While the romantic part is cute, you make Hannibal Lecter look like a well adjusted citizen. 
So you have sex with women that you don't respect and you crush on women that are more confident than you because you're too much of a coward to talk them eye to eye. You don't respect women and that's why you don't deserve one. 
Maybe if you stopped wallowing in your misery all the time and gathered the courage to look a woman in the eye, you wouldn't be having this problem.
  
  
 Snakes & Lattes on College
 
Well, I never saw myself posting on flipping missed connections on Craigslist, but the way we made eye contact as you left was really unique. My friend and I were playing dorky children's game, a dinosaur game then a pirate ship balance game and you said our conversation was hilarious. You overheard us talking about the Toronto indie game scene and said you knew some people in it. I had a few beverages and it was pretty loud anyway, so I couldn't hear the names of your friends you mentioned and said I wasn't familiar with them. You were really cute. As you left, I wondered if you'd look back and make pretty intense eye contact with me, then you did exactly that. Neat! Maybe we could play pirate dinosaurs sometime. I was the dude in the baseball cap with a beard getting far more excited about a pirate game than I probably should, but tell me the name of the game you were playing last and I'll believe it's really you!
  
  
 Brunette tonight at cabal
 
Absolutely beautiful in your jumpsuit dress. Wish I had spoken to you.
I had my blue Jays hat on.
  
  
 Tattoo on the TTC
 
Hey there. Not sure if you will see this, but you tapped me on the shoulder on the bus and asked me what the symbols were on my tattoo.  I wanted to chat a little more but you put your headphones back on right after.  If you do see this, let me know what bus we were on, and what the symbol was and where.
  
  
 re karma
 
the injured party has no obligation to the offender, unless, it is as Mark Twain says \"Forgiveness is the scent the violet leaves on the heel which has crushed it.\".
The only obligation, ever, is to the children, to the future.
Do not confuse retribution with reclamation.
Do not confuse a Trojan horse for an apology.

 J.D. the Hypnotist
 
A few years ago I enjoyed a brief conversation with you about hypnosis but lost track. I've always wondered what might have been.
I remember you mentioning being certified in London. If you're reading this, please get back in touch. 

  
  
 We walked on coxwell and went to shoppers
 
I've seen you pass by my place on coxwell few times but never had the opportunity to say hi. 
I was walking to shoppers today(July 30th 10.30pm) and you were on the road with me, I didn't recognize you until you were at the cashier, I came out looking for you as soon as I paid and you just vanished :(
Hopefully you see this or I run into you again.
You have blonde hair, you were wearing a light hoodie, shorts and flip flops. 
If you think this might be you, I'd love to say Hi.
P.s - I remember 2 of the items you purchased.

 Caribana Queens on the Lakeshore East Train
 
Taking a shot here, I met two sexy black girls on the train today who were dressed up to be in the Caribana parade.  I must say I was instantly turned on,  we chatted for a few minutes and they asked me if I had ever been before to which I said no, and they said that I'm missing out and I should come and check out the experience......Let's just say that's not the only experience I wanna check out.....Hit me up if you wanna get together sometime.  And if there are any other sexy black girls that read this and are digging a BWC.  Don't be shy....
  
  
 You asked me for a cig on Dupont/Madison
 
Hello!
At approximately 8:30 pm on Saturday night, I was standing on DuPont one Street West of Madison Ave and you came by on your bike.
You stopped and asked me for a cigarette and then I gave you a light.
I felt like an idiot as I watched you ride away because I wanted to say something, but was lost for words as all I could do was admire your beauty.
I doubt you will see this post, but no matter what, I thank you for showing such a beautiful smile.
  
  
 Please don't shut me out any longer - I can't stop loving you
 
Please forgive me;
It still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss
It's getting better baby
No one can better this
Still holding on
You're still the one
First time our eyes met
Same feeling I get
Only feels much stronger
I wanna love you longer
Do you still turn the fire on?
So if you're feeling lonely, don't
You're the only one I'll ever want
I only want to make it go
So if I love you a little more than I should
Please forgive me, I know not what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me, this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do
Please believe me (oh believe it), every word I say is true
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Still feels like our best times are together
Feels like the first touch
Still getting closer baby
Can't get closer enough
Still holding on
You're still number one
I remember the smell of your skin
I remember everything
I remember all the moves
I remember you yeah
I remember the nights, you know I still do
So if you're feeling lonely, don't
You're the only one I'll ever want
I only want to make it go
So if I love you a little more than I should
Please forgive me, I know not what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me, this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do
Please believe me (oh believe it), every word I say is true
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
The one thing I'm sure of
Is the way we make love
The one thing I depend on
Is for us to stay strong
With every word and every breath I'm praying
That's why I'm saying
Please forgive me, I know not what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me, this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do
Babe believe it, every word I say is true
Please forgive me, if I can't stop loving you
No, believe, I don't know what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you

Hi Lily,
Was it really you last night? Hope to see you alone some day and if you like I'll take you to my cottage for a boat ride, it is nice up there this time of the year.

Meaningful eye contact while you were playing with your small dog.
I was laying on the grass nearby.  I am interested.

 Damn u we're cute and damn I was dumb near ROM on Bloor
 
Hey I asked u if u just finished your shift, you said yea and we talked at the end I asked you ur name but didn't finish and ask for the number because we split different ways, I should've asked.
Tell me what my name was and where you work..
  
  
 You are so gorgeous!
 
Hey,
I know the chances that you ever read this is like me winning lottery but at lest I tried. You were locked out and standing by your apartment door waiting for your bf to come and I said hi and asked you if everything is ok. You are so beatific and gorgeous, wish you were single :((
  
  
 Sam & Patricia - Love In An Elevator?
 
Hey Patricia! You're the neighbour with a beautiful smile whom I had the pleasure of meeting just a few minutes ago in the elevator of the highrise where we reside. (Un)fortunately, today the usually dysfunctional elevating device worked as intended - drunken caretakers and lowball maintenance crews notwithstanding; all too quickly, we arrived at my floor with no time for anything more than a quick handshake. Before I could ask for your number the doors closed and you were whisked away to a higher plane of existence with panoramic views. 
Shall we continue our chat over coffee at Rooster?
  
  
 Bovine sex club 25 June
 
Met you at the end of the evening. You look like Keith Richards. We were both born in 1957. I had to rush off to catch a ride home.
  
  
 Maria and Mahia Pravda
 
I spoke to both of you right after the midnight show. I said I will be right back but when I returned, you had left. I really wanted to ask Maria for a date but didn't get the chance to. Anyways if by any chance you see this, I would love to hear from you.
  
  
 You gave me a ride, I left my backpack in your car
 
Last night you were kind enough to drive me home because you saw I was too drunk to bike myself. 
The problem: I seem to have left my backpack in your car and have no way of contacting you. It was a MEC backpack. I mostly need it because it contains my house keys and a few other items of importance. 
If you've heard of a friend telling a story about a backpack they've gained please let me know! 
I was picked up around eglinton and oakwood and it was probably around 3-4am.

 C: We met over karaoke
 
We met at a bar where you slid over to introduce yourself. You came with a friend, and I didn't want to overstep, but then we started to dance a bit, and you kinda made my night.
I'd like to meet you for a show, or else just coffee. You seem really cool.
I joked that you knew a lot about something when you gave me some advice; what advice did you give me?
 - D.
  
  
 Lindsay with co-workers
 
So, I hope you found your way to work alright that morning. Sorry if my 6:45am alarm woke you up super early. Had a great time, thanks for the beer.
I regret not getting your number, would be nice to see you again.
  
  
 Met you and cousin on a park hill before Slipknot
 
My 2 friends and i met you and your cousin in Harbour Square park on a hill before the Slipknot concert on July 19th. We talked it up and you seemed interested in me. Your name was Alisha and you were from London, same area we were from. Prob a long shot but thought you would want to hang out.  And i remember you said you are 31 and im 32.

 With a withering..
 
With a withering i'm kinda fearful for tryin 
Didnt i do it too many times
Now a stranger for corresponding crimes
made me made from mindful mistakes
...all alone in this place
looking into the one that is myself
carrying oceans of water thru emotions.. cast up on that higher shelf
locked by sayin if peaks n mountains could erase the distance between me to where i went
i am forever hushed by the hell .... above my eyes
when can i ever go back in my way
what will  allow me to change the past in one day
faking me more science isnt constructed to be adored
face me  if  u had it by the core
intentions that meant so much
i was her monster.... 
in a freak i bore that crutch
With a withering i'm kinda fearful for tryin 
Didnt i do it too many times
Now a stranger for corresponding crimes
shmOoOoOoOooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

  
  
 Chad
 
I wonder how you are? Wish I knew how to get in touch.
Are you still seeing that vapid girl with the dead eyes?
  
  
 Invisible soundless sneezes.
 
You're short; your name starts with a C; and your smile is not only stunning, but infectious as well; something in the way your eyes sparkle. That is all.
  
  
 Eglinton west - 32 bus- cute red hair girl
 
This morning we were both in the 32 bus riding to Eglinton west subway.
I got in and sat down at the back which were opposite to your seat :)
We made a few eye contact and thought there might be a connection :) it's actually the 2nd time I see you in the morning :)
I'm not sure you'll ever read this but if you do, drop me a line. Tell me what I was wearing ?

Friday, July 29 around 9pm: we were peeing at the urinals at the same time in the washroom. I like what I saw when I finished before you. We tried to wait a bit after but...
Let me know if you see this. To confirm, you can finish the sentence to confirm who left first or what shoe you were wearing.
Love to connect.
  
  
 Hot guy on Via train 668
 
We were both travelling business class and exchanged eye contact a few times through the trip. You were sitting next to some drunk guy (or maybe just an asshole) who kept hollering at the staff and made a ruckus when he got up. 
You're an athletic guy, well-dressed, salt and pepper beard. You spent most of the trip reading before getting off at Kingston. I'm the tall one with the moustache, and I was headed all the way to Montreal. 
If you're in Toronto a bunch, hit me up?
  
  
 510 spadina south Wednesday morning - white shorts, alone shirt
 
I sat next your ftiend but couldn't keep my eyes off of you.  Your shirt said 'alone'  but with a pretty face like yours that won't last too long.  I noticed you glancing at me.  I was glancing at you too. 
Was there something there? 
I think so. 
You're beautiful

 Polite driver
 
You were the young dark skin driver on the TTC Junction bus around mid morning today. You appear 
to be polite to the customers & in control. I entered the bus & we smiled.  Would like to have coffee 
with you as appreciation if you are interested.
  
  
 couple at the zoo
 
Today, the 29th we saw a couple at the zoo in the water park.  You were with a bunch of people there.  So you know who you are, your nieces name is Lily.  The man had a red T-shirt on.  We started chatting at the polar bear exhibit about our kids.  
You seem like a really nice couple.  If you read this we'd love to get together and have a few drinks.  A night out without the kids.  We are 45 and 41.
  
  
 Dundas Street car west. Red shirt ripped jeans.
 
Most beautiful girl I've ever seen.  Offered you a seat and ended up sitting next to you.  Dark hair,  red shirt,  ripped jeans.  You put your earphones in before i could say hi.  When i got off we glanced.  Were you into me as much as i was into you?
A shot in the dark.  Hope it works!

 Boy in wheelchair?
 
So this is a long shot but I've always wanted to post on here, and you were way too cute to pass up!
I had just gotten on the 506 streetcar, and you were in a parked bus next to it. I believe you were in a wheelchair on the bus? You smiled at me, and we looked at one another several times before my streetcar started moving away, and I looked back at you. 
If this is ringing a bell, please let me know what you were wearing on your wrist and what colour my hair was. I'd love to meet you for a drink!

 This city is crawling with hot construction workers
 
Summer season is construction season in Toronto.  
I drive & walk through the city every day and see so many handsome & yummy looking men working in the sun. 
On St Clair, Bathurst, College, Eglinton - pretty much everywhere. I see them checking me out, I know I look good but how do I get you to ask me out while you're at work
It's a shame there isn't a pub where all the tradesmen go after work.  
Is there anything sexier than a man that can work with his hands? 
A man who can protect the people he cares about, a man that can hunt or fix whats broken & be self sufficient.  
I wonder if there are men left in Toronto who are traditional alpha males who don't buy into politically correct identity politics. It seems the men I meet here are so left wing they are almost castrated. 
Just wondering.
  
  
 Wishing I'd said something
 
Just got off eastbound subway at Donlands. 
Me- stubbly hair , dark glasses, black jeans, black vest
You- STUNNING. Brunette , undercut, blonde shock of hair. 
I stared, just beautiful. 
I should have introduced myself.

Hello.
First...thanks again for your care for my little boy. 
I know that this will not reach you, but I wanted to express my brief experience with you.
I have never in my life been overcome with this mesmerizing feelings that have overcome me.  I am lost for words actually. Maybe it was your eyes.....maybe it was your hair. (even though you like curly) but I think it was your Aura !. your energy.
I just felt i was embraced by it.
I wish I was younger.
Best of luck in your career.
Be Well.

gimmie a signal
i wish i could have been warned
kept protected im so haunted to you 
like an embrace to ur face
i fill this space
its all seemd empty n gone
i could only  begin questioning all to be wrong
inside of me regretting that i was fearful to feel
to me nothing else is real
all the rest is not a part of me
not memories but  reoccurring dreams..
thinking and missing 
to watch as i many times did
i lay awake forever 
too much thinking....never blinking
unexpected and dormant i lie
in a daze about it
still n lost
u r my haze
gimmie  a signal
i wish I could have been warned

  
  
 Red head on the streetcar
 
I feel silly writing this and not saying hi when I had the chance. You are the drop dread beautiful red head that sat across from me on the harbourfront streetcar around 1030pm. I loved your smile. Hit me up if you see this.
  
  
 \"Damn sexy\" guy at Goodlife
 
Wanted to strike up a conversation, but I wasn't sure if the guy you were with was your boyfriend or not. We had a good look at each other at the showers and I wish we were alone. Let me know if you're cut or uncut so I know it's you!
  
  
 Taking the GO Train
 
I take the GO train everyday and get off at Union as I see the rush of people,  some dressed in suits and others casual hoping that maybe one just ONE would even stop to talk or take a second look. This city is lively,  the beautiful skyscrapers,  the noise,  yet it's near impossible to find love in this city.  I can't remember the last time someone noticed me,  or someone I was interested in felt the same. Love and romance have become foreign to me.  
Loneliness in this city sucks.  I guess some of us are just unlovable.  
.. Alone, I feel alone
When I'm living in a building
Like a tooth at heaven's throat
True, it's a beautiful view
But you know they're gonna set it on fire
When they feel like something new
And you can get me work
But I can't work for free
I've got a room downtown
With a bed and a big TV... 
**Please don't flag this.  I have no love life, can you at least let me rant a little and share my sadness and emptiness. :(**

in me 
like dreams that dream 
so stay
stay so
summer nights so stay still.... while keyboards at play
deeper sounding
falling where i am rebounding
hoody hides me hidden in hives of beats to create
if i tell u that all u do is make me think of u
when it ends.... it gets all grey
in the void jumbling juggling what are my feelings 
that this is the way.... it turns
every..... other day
(((hhhugs))) from the front
((hhhugs))) from behind
(((hhhugs)))) to hugs
(((hhhugs))) that hug all the time
if i could 
would u stand and listen
to the love u make me rhyme
so stay
stay so

Hey,
You were the cutesy petite hottie at the Starbucks around 7 PM this evening (Thursday). 
You were having a fruity beverage seated by the corner around the condiments counter. 
Our eyes connected but too bad we didn't! ;-) LOL! 
If you happen to see this posting, then let's connect!

 Stopped beside me at Keele & Sheppard
 
This afternoon, Thursday July 28th, at around 6:30pm, we were driving north on Keele approaching Sheppard. We both stopped at the lights... I was making a left turn and you were continuing to drive north in a blue pick up truck.... Very good looking, I wanted to smile, but not sure if I would get a turned head.... If by any chance you see this... Let me know what I was driving....
  
  
 Goodlife Kingsmill
 
Saw you in the change room naked and holding your shorts in front of your hard cock..but not really hiding it. Guys would walk in and were kind of shocked but nobody did anything. Loved that you got off on that and I want it.
Describe what you look like. I'm the italian muscular guy.
  
  
 re: Amoco pizza
 
You deleted your post.  I know the pizza is worse than dominos. I got sick as a dog eating that shite. Stomach pain and heart burn. I heard they put wing sauce on the pizza. Crunchy chicken bones cartledge is added no extra charge.
If you order an 8 dollar chicken sanwich expect two deli thin slices of chicken.  
The regulars might get better quantity of food but the quality requires a visit from the health inspector. 
Overpriced and pure crap.
The anchovies are good everywhere.
If you want the best pizza you aint ever going to get it here.
If you want an affordable decent pizza,Bitondo Pizzeria
4.3 rating but should be 5 on the pizza.
11 Clinton St, Toronto, ON M6J 2P1
Open today 11AM--11PM 
Prices are more competitive and the pizza is gourmet.
Metro does have a better deal regardless if its Wednesday or not.
Buy pizza on a turesday and save more money.
Im an idiot too i tip well only to never see the bitch again or not.
Health inspector needs to visit amicos
  
  
 Alone this weekend
 
Hello everyone. My name is Marc. Just wondering if anyone out there was in the same situation I was. 
I find myself completely alone this weekend. I would like to meet someone new and see where things go. 
I'm a 28 year old freelance writer. I run my own digital marketing business. 
Interests include reading (sci-fi, classics), movies, hiking, yoga, dancing, cooking and trying new things. I volunteer a lot, as I enjoy making a difference in the lives of others. 
I'm an introvert, looking to step outside my comfort zone. However I also have a great sense of humour. 
For example: Why did the cookie not go to work? 
He felt kind of crummy. Get it? 
If you're still with me I'd love to hear from you. Maybe we can go for a bike ride. We can start with a coffee or a drink and go from there. Something fun. 
Let's get to know each other. No pressure, no expectations. 
Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks for reading.
  
  
 Sexy blonde woman at Starbucks on The Queensway
 
To the sexy blonde woman sitting across from me at Starbucks right now on The Queensway, I would love to get to know you better!
You're reading the book 'All is not forgotten', drinking a coffee, have an iphone with a red case, wearing a purple shirt, blue skirt, light pink fingernails and darker pink toe nails with sandals and have a black bag with you.
I think you're extremely attractive and would love to take you out for drinks or dinner or both.
I'm the guy sitting to your right on the computer.

  
  
 Goodlife - Wellington and York
 
See you most Sundays around noon or slightly later. Sometimes we are in the gym area other times in the locker room. You are dark brown and slim. I am older white  and fit. Would like to get to know you if you are interested in expanding your social circle.
  
  
 I spotted you at GoodLife Ferrand today
 
I spotted you doing shoulders today during lunch at GoodLife in North York. You had on sweats and a white tee and tattoos. Not sure if you swing this way but thought I'd try anyways. Let me know what colour shirt I was wearing.
  
  
 Katie from Pickering/Ajax
 
I know this is a longshot but I'm looking for that sweet, beautiful redhead that I had such a great connection with. You always knew how to make me laugh and always told me how handsome I was. We lost contact with each other a couple of years ago and I can't stop thinking about you. I would love to rekindle what we had. 
I lost your contact information and don't know any other way of getting in touch with you, so if you do happen to read this tell me who your favourite NFL team is. 
Miss you so much xo

 Spadina and Fort york
 
Saw you in the elevator on Friday night.  I was riding up with a girl and you were going to the 9th floor I think. You were a gorgeous brown woman in your late 20s early 30s. We locked eyes 3 or 4 times and you couldn't stop smiling. I am the tall, white guy with the tank top on It brightened up my weekend to see that smile. Would love to see you again. Tell me what you were holding in your hand.
  
  
 We got soaked when we left the jay game (3 years ago)
 
So we went to a Jays fame, got drunk, and then we left and walked into the middle of a rain storm and we both got soaked. But we did not care, and especially, you did not care.
We ended up going back to my place and getting changed and passing out, but i need to tell you that I have thought of this day many times and the opportunity that was lost.
Our relationship has been long and complex, but I think about reaching out often and am choosing to do it in this cowardly yet wishful way so as to set the right expectation.
Please respond and we can start by reliving that day
  
  
 To The Gorgeous Girl on the Sherbourne Bus (every morning)
 
I'll be honest, I've been checking you out for a while now. But today I caught you checking me out as well, so I figured I'd post this. 
We were on the Sherbourne bus headed south around 9:15 AM. I was standing but some people got off, so I sat down across-ish from you. Couldn't stop staring...sorry for that. But I noticed when I looked up, most times you were looking back. 
You were wearing a black sleeveless shirt and shorts, I can't remember them in detail because I was too busy looking at your face. You were wearing red lipstick (I think...unless your lips are just really red) and you looked amazing. We met eyes a few times before you got off at King street. 
So, tl;dr: you're a gorgeous girl who rides the Sherbourne bus every day, and I feel like we were checking each other out today, so let's chat. Respond with what I was wearing.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
  
  
 M.B. - I can't let you go from my heart
 
I don't know what to do, so I write here to \"get it off my chest\"....  Its kind of foolish as I know you don't read these things... i guess my hope is that \"publicly\" sharing this sort if diary entry will be cathartic...
Its been over a year since you shut the door in my face.  I dont blame you, how could I... You gave me more than enough time to take care of things so I could commit myself to you... I so hope you don't see those only as wasted years with me....  Now I've come to learn indirectly that you've not only moved on, but are now with someone and you're having a baby with them.  I'm so sincerely happy for you as I know you wanted a child.  You will be a wonderful mother... He is very lucky to be having a child with you.
The thing is, to my surprise to late, I'm again reminded that you are the one... The only one... That I cannot let go.... Even when I found out you were pregnant with your new partner, all I could think was that I still love you, and wish to God we were still together.  Foolish thought? Probably, but it's my thoughts nevertheless...
So after years of being unsure if there was a point in making the necessary moves to be with you long-term, thinking because we were incompatible, we couldn't make each other happy, I now realize that to be happy, I have to scour the earth to find someone just like you.... You were the greatest love of my life... The biggest mistake of my life was letting you slip away... I still love you M.B..... I love you more than I've ever loved anyone... more than I ever showed you... more than you'll ever know.... Even now, I love you deeply with all my heart, and I can't let anyone else in.
I truly don't know why... Could be fear, pride, self defense, shame, fear of rejection, i don't know.... But for some reason in spite of my true ongoing love for you, I can't bring myself to call you... I'm so sorry for not moving in with you and marrying you when I had the chance... I'm so sorry for everything...
I wish you and your family to be all blessings and peace and joy... Take care my friend and my love.  I'm sorry for not showing you the love you deserved because of fear and doubt, and know that I'll love you forever.

 YVR>YYZ: flight AC148, seat 30B
 
beautiful girl, we've just landed after the tiring delayed flight..
you caught my eye the moment you boarded the plane.
I thought of so many ways to strike a conversation for when we get off the flight, I even thought of having the flight attendant to pass you a note.
well.. I suck, I didn't connect.
I kick myself for not saying hello, I got shy because I think you were with your parents.
anyways.. I'm not a creep, I just have not met someone that makes my heartbeat race as much as from your glances.
maybe, somehow, through some Craigslist magic I can take you out for dinner..

ITS HARD
I HATE GETTIN  LOST IN IT
not the first time but every other 
echoin the second chances
it makes more sense if it doesn't pass 
waves of a conundrum

we r all fighting duality in lOnliness
void where u r gone
taking the talk in left over separations
this is my temporary emptiness..where u  r not there
imagined implications inclusive to infin=ity
special invitation to my tea guest
spin  me to a spindle
stop me on a static pulse
this is a continuous awareness..
my inner soul is so dead weighted
before urrr lessssssssss
u will away all the rest
u will always mean more to me
ITS HARD
I HATE GETTIN  LOST IN IT

 Asian Dude at Goodlife-
 
Tonight you came in by yourself around 9:30 PM, you Asian young wearing a green T-shirt. We exchange looks in the change room and have seen each other before. You were doing legs when I left.
Let me know if you want to hang?
  
  
 Before Blue Jays game
 
We rode the streetcar together then I asked for directions. \"See you in the stadium,\" I said. \"I'll be the one in the Jays hat,\" you replied. Funny man. Hope you and your friend enjoyed the afternoon. If you want to watch the game with me sometime, drop me a line. And if you do, I hope you will call me by name so I'll know it's you. 

  
  
 Midevil times green table 6
 
You sat beside me at midevil times today with your son. With your beautiful body and sexy red hair. It was hard to keep my eyes on the show. You had several tattoos one with a skull on your hand. I am married but   found myself extremely attractedto you. Did you feel the same?
  
  
 Citizen post (depressed?)
 
I've been through all the shit, the hell, the misery - and it sucks.  But I have managed to sustain a happy life now, I have.  If anyone needs to vent, talk, spew, yell, scream - I am officially offering you to message me.

Hi, travelling west before 3 PM. Nice tee and cap. I was sitting behind you. Not sure if you noticed my smile. We should go to a Fringe show together once. ;)
  
  
 For Lovely J.
 
My darling,
can you feel the molecules shift as we gather
to begin
I just felt the first raindrop -
oh what joy.
I long for you
with all my heart and soul,
yet I cannot imagine anything
beyond your soft and beautiful hand 
in mine,
for you see,
that single jolt
might just be
the death of me. 
I hope you understand.

 Cute and short brunette chick at Starbucks Bedford and Bloor location.

 To the guy who got off the subway and had to take the shuttle bus.
 
A few nights ago around like midnight I was on the subway and I saw a guy who sat across and to the side of me on the subway. The subway was close for \" track improvement\" we got on the same shuttle bus and he sat like 2 rows behind me. He was hella good looking. If the shuttle bus wasn't crowded I would've said something. So mystery dude if you see this what what I doing on the subway/ what was a I wearing ? This is a long shot
  
  
 Eaton Center Bar
 
Hey! I was walking by the bar in the food court when your beautiful eyes met mine. You were sitting at the bar having a drink with your friend. I would have stopped to talk but I was in a hurry.

 Central Spa This Afternoon
 
I arrived around 12:30pm & saw you in the locker room about to get dressed to leave. 
We chatted briefly while we were both changing. 
Would've loved to play with you! 
Any chance of you seeing this? 
What did we say to each other

  
  
 On the subway heading south
 
Hey. We were sitting accross from each other on the subway. I was wearing a black tank top. I got off at St George. You had a dress on and glasses and blond Hair. Hoping you see this and contact me.
  
  
 Sexy Brown Guy Yonge Subway Southbound
 
You were the hot brown guy on the southbound Yonge subway train. You were wearing ripped teams and an MTA baseball cap. We looked at each other quite a bit. You were looking at we when I got off the platform at Wellesley station. I was the guy with the glasses, beard and and the jeans shorts. I really hope you see this.
  
  
 Bloor West Village Beauty
 
We intersected one another just outside the High Park Entrance on Bloor, proceeded to snake through a procession of kids at the lights and then we continued to walk west on the south side of Bloor where we split; you I noticed into Runnymede Library and me into my nearby office.
Thought you were beautiful and didn't think much more of it UNTIL I popped out of my office and there you were again; crossed paths with each of us travelling in the opposite direction this time.
Hope this finds you...
  
  
 Girl on southbound ttc subway this morning
 
Hey
I was in subway this morning and you were with a black female friend of yours. I was wearing a blue suit with my sunglasses on. I noticed that you were checking up on me and literally scanned me from head to toe. Lol. 
I wanted to say you are cute but you and i had to get off at union and we went separate paths. 
If you'd like we can grab a coffee and be friends. I wish i see you again.

 Re Re Still missing you
 
I am not a rebounder\"
Yes, you are.  You are sitting here posting messages about the guy and trying to compare new dates to him as well (that are never good enough according to you, gee, I wonder why).  
YOU AREN'T OVER YOUR EX!
Do you also post messages about people you are over and no longer care about?

  
  
 Re: Still missing you
 
I date often but find myself longing for you\"
You are one of the main problems with modern dating, you are wasting the time of men that are actually looking for a real relationship.  I am so sick and tired of time wasting rebounders clogging up the dating sites.
Just got out of a relationship?  TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF AND STOP USING OTHERS AS A TEMPORARY CRUTCH DUE TO YOUR CHILDISHNESS AND INSECURITIES.  Stop wasting peoples time!
Signed, a guy that's been on over 80 dates in 2 years - re-bounders are an epidemic.
  
  
 To the woman who flashed me on the 88 bus yesterday
 
You were sitting opposite me and kept crossing and uncrossing your legs.  What a view!  Your lacy panties left just the right amount to the imagination.  Thanks for making my commute!
  
  
 Adelaide john patio with wooden tables i had a suit
 
I saw you, looked up and you smiled as you were walking by the patio with the wooden table where I waa sitting. The resto was called le catrin (or something) and you wore jeans. It was too fast for me to realize what happened
  
  
 Fraser
 
We met on the final day of Pride (Sunday), just before last call. Dancing up a storm.
I'm still SO smitten! 
Would love to stay in touch, even though it's been several weeks.
Email me and tell me how I learned your name :)
  
  
 Hey you
 
You're involved with someone new and yet you still make time to catch up with me. 
What gives? Are you waiting to see if things will change on my end? 
It's more complicated than I let on. I'm sorry I can't tell you directly. You set the boundaries on our interactions and I'm respecting that. I'll always respect where you are in life, and not interfere. 
Hope you're doing well. I'm always around if you want to talk.
  
  
 hair stylist Martha
 
I owe you a huge apology. I tried to reach you through Facebook but you either blocked me or shut down your account.
Either way my conscious is bothering me and I have to say I'm sorry. Your life was troubled enough before I added drama to it. I'm sorry
  
  
 Cute girl - waiting for streetcar took shuttle bus
 
Hi, 
We talked for a few seconds while waiting for the streetcar and then the shuttle bus. I thought you were leaving so I stopped on the earlier shuttle bus stop... should have followed you. When you got on the bus I was too shy to say anything.
Reply telling me what I was wearing, let's meet up again :)
  
  
 I LooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOv u Im sorry
 
i lov u i'm sorry
i didn't want what i didn't do
... yet i'm coming apart like i never knew
with this nothing is more
what is to be ....are vacancies in my head
i say little so what is meant... was read
i'm always thiking about u
why this happens changes the questions to all that is appreciated  and truu
to me your perfect in ever way
it comes but once and continues every day
is it upon merely meeting that actions escape an utterance
is that why emotions are acted unintentionally  wrong
but it does
and it jus goes on
seldom surmised selfishly seared ...so start something significant
standing in surprise
a  story told
a poem shared
fingers brushing on fingers
....sensitive touches 
showing without words how one is cared
let it give in ......to a love where we are dared
i lov u i'm sorry
i didn't want what i didn't do
... yet i'm coming apart like i never knew
shmoOoOoOoOoloVvVsssstU
  
  
 Lovely at Lee Valley
 
On the off chance..
Struck up a little chit chat while waiting for our orders. Once again at the till.
I think you are delightful. 
Wish I had asked which direction you were headed, for a little walk and talk!
Fingers crossed our paths cross again.
Not an axe handle but a?!

  
  
 Goodlife 137 Yonge
 
I was coming down the elevator, you were coming up. Eye contact, and you came back down and back into the change room. You stood near the mirror while I got undressed and put a towel on. I went to the shower and we stared at each other again.
Drop me a line - you are sexy! I waited for you in the steam room.
Tell me where you went when I went to the showers.
  
  
 Niagara walking dog
 
I saw you walking your dog at the corner. You took my breath away and I said nothing when our eyes met. Such is life. But what a moment...
  
  
 beautiful brown man at the university tonight
 
I saw you tonight, near the U of T campus.  I think you are a student, probably post graduate.  You watched as my daughter and I were walking down the sidewalk, and you laughed when I yelled out the name Josh (my daughter's boyfriend's name whom we were meeting) and my daughter screamed \" Mom stop it, I'm dying of embarrassment'.  I saw you smiling at me when I left them.   You are around 30-35, dark brown, casually dressed, with a knapsack.  I had the long hair pulled back in a braid down my back, and I was carrying the gym bag.  Let me you tell you, I live downtown, I have a bohemian lifestyle (meaning I hold a job, can string a few sentences together and am single but believe that relationships come in all different shapes and sizes and dont like to put labels on things)  I think you would like me.  If this is you, feel free to respond, either to me directly or post your message back on missed connections and I will respond.

Long shot...Looked twice.  Should have said hi.

Say hello now if you see this.
(It's telling me this isn't long enough so I'll type nonsense until it's good...haha)
Thought this would have gone without saying, but please identify which corner, and something specific about each of us in your response...(Turns out some people don't have lives...or even Netlix...And the latter is only about 8 bucks.)
  
  
 Blow in the woods
 
I first saw you in the parking lot sitting in your car waiting for the right guy.... I guess it was me..
We went into the woods, I started sucking you, then you sucked me.
I should be given you my info. But was in a hurry to go. 
If you see this and want to get together again, tell me what car you were driving...
Hope you see this and connect again.

You were the the cutsey dark-haired check wearing a skirt seated at the main student lounge area at the 5th floor of the OISE building at UofT Downtown campus around 4:30 PM.

It's summer! 
I walk by you every day. Whether it's a summer dress, yoga pants, or jean shorts - you are all beautiful. I would approach you but you'll think of me as creepy. So...let's make it easy. Let's meet. I'll compliment you. We become friends. Netflix and chill. Blah blah blah...
  
  
 Pretty blonde on TTC Yonge Line
 
Wow,  I didn't want to be creepy, but it was hard not to stare at you.  You were sipping some sort of coffee shop concoction.  You looked cool in sunglasses, too.
I managed a weak smile before I left, and you replied with a much better example.I'm less shy most of the time.  I blame you.  :)
Ah well, get in touch if you feel it.  Let me know about what I looked like/what I was doing.  It'd be fun to chat!
  
  
 love the beige pumps
 
they make your long legs look great today 
although you always look good when I see you
just wanted to pass along the compliment 

  
  
 375 Yonge Street - you sucked my cock
 
Theater 3 at 375 Yonge Street
We were there between 11 PM until 1 AM
Sunday night July 24 into Monday morning July 25
Throughout the evening we were stroking our cocks with other guys
while we all watched straight porn on the screen and that porn was good
at one point you were with another dude in a private booth - you were sucking his cock
I was watching through the crack of the door way
I couldn't see much and I wish I could have watched
I went back into the theater to continue to watch the porn and stroke my cock
You then came in to the theater and sat in front of me - I moved to sit beside you
We started to stroke our cocks and I love watching a guy or guys stroking their cock
you then leaned over to suck my cock and I loved every minute of it and you swallowed my load
I then watched you bust a big nut yourself all over the place - it was closing soon after that
Would love to meet up again and repeat it all over again. 
Please tell me what you told me after I busted my nut in your mouth.
  
  
 375 Yonge Street - we jerked together

we were there to meet up with the women that was going to be there
though she didn't show up or she was in theatre 3 and we were in theatre 1 and 2

wish we sat beside each other, edged more then stroke our cocks for a while

 Beautiful Girl in the grey dress
 
You and your friend were standing in line ahead of me yesterday around 4:45PM.  I couldn't take my eyes off you, your beauty had me in a trance.  You looked at me and our eyes met briefly, but I was at a loss for words.  If you want to talk sometime, tell me what you ordered so I know it's the right person.
Take care!
  
  
 Lost Englishman
 
I had that lost-tourist look at the airport and you were very helpful. Meant to ask you if you wanted to go for a drink and something to eat to say thank you ... It had been a long trip! I wasn't thinking straight!

 Wayhome: we stopped you for a cigarette sat night at Phillip watson
 
My friend and I stopped you for a cigarette on Sat night. You told us you just drove up for the night. You told me about harvest festival. You and I sat down to watch Phillip Watson.  We shared a moment. You took my number down...but I think you got it wrong.  Just to make this a bit more specific, you told me that youre middle eastern. Please find me!
  
  
 Asian guy on the Yonge line
 
Around 10:00 Monday night, I was travelling northbound on the Yonge line.  You saw me checking you out and you got up and moved to the seat beside me.
If you're interested, get back to me with some details.
  
  
 Barista at Red Line Coffee
 
You were the really tall, very cute and witty barista that was working today at Red Line. I was the dorky loiterer who didn't tell you this in person, but opted to use the highly unreliable method of posting a missed connection on Craigslist, because...well, I'm a dork. 
I overheard read: was casually trying to eavesdrop] that you might be single. Wouldn't you know, I am too. 
If (by some miracle) you see this, and if I made any impression whatsoever today, message me back and let me know something about our interaction that sticks out. 
PS. I appreciated your music selection. Two thumbs way up for Christine and the Queens :)
  
  
 You helped me find what I wanted
 
Me: tall, covering my nervousness
You: outgoing and tattooed
I wanted to talk to you at more length, but thought that you probably don't like being hit on at work (or might think I was too much of a weirdo). If that's not the case, I'd love to connect. I was looking for plastic but all you had left was chrome ;)

  
  
 re: i am not that dude
 
dear ugly unpleasant white guy,
while i am not particularly inclined to offer up my feet for licking, i do feel that i must offer my thanks for your hilarious email. you are not that dude, but nonetheless you sound like a pretty cool dude. i wish you luck on your quest for your very own library waifu, with delicate feet you can lick to your heart's content. when that day comes, perhaps you guys can join me and my asian adonis in selling our souls at robarts. until then, stay drunk my friend.
best,
library waifu #1
  
  
 White audi at shell on brownsline
 
It was on Sunday around 730 pm.
Wow you are very beautiful I seen you in your car I kept looking at you and every time you looked up I just had to turn my head as you walked in to buy something I could not think of anything to say to you. 
This is a very long shot that you would ever be on here but if you are and you would like to go for a coffee or and nice lunch or dinner tell me what kind of car I was driving make or color

 Sexy White Shirt Jean Skirt - Eye contact with Shirtless guy on bike
 
Never posted here, but I remember you well and I can't stop thinking about you. I was coming back from the gym and we stopped at the light going westbound on college at college and university. You were a sexy white girl with a white shirt and jean skirt. We made eye contact, and your eyes said you wanted more.. the way you stretched seemed like you wanted me to appreciate all of you... and I so did.   I want to meet you, I actually turned around and tried to find you afterwards but you were gone already. You are so hot and I would love to see you again.
  
  
 Ritz-Carleton Spa
 
You: Caucasian hot older exec type with salt-pepper hair. 
Me: the thin toned brown young boy in sexy shorts. 
You kept checking me out in the change room and the sauna.  You sat next to me in the wet sauna and followed me into the dry sauna where we both got naked. I wanted to say something but I was too nervous. I went into the lounge area thinking how to approach you.  The attendant called me in for my spa service.  I was hoping you would be there when I came back, but you were gone :(  If you see this, tell me what color(s) shorts was I wearing, I would love to meet you!

 Colorful hair at Rose and Sons Dupont
 
I was in for brunch on the 24th of July. You seated us and I couldn't keep my eyes off of you. You had teal hair in pigtails, pale skin, and dark eyeshadow. You were ever so enticing.
I asked you about the receipt breakdown. 
If your interest is piqued at all, feel free to respond. I would love to hear from you!
  
  
 I can tell.
 
I can tell you want to know my name,
I can tell you want to be in my world.
I can tell you want me for you girl,
by the way you're looking at me...
I can tell I'm always on your mind,

Tell you that I'm really, really, new.
I like the way you're looking at me...
  
  
 Pearl Restaurant - Bayview Village
 
I've never done this before and I don't know if this posting will lead anywhere, but I thought why not at least give it a try. 
You were having supper with a lady who seemed to be your mother around 7pm today (Sun, July 24th, 2016). You were wearing a red shirt, with short black hair, Asian guy between the ages of late teens to mid twenties. Not exactly what you were talking about with your mom, but at one point you were asking your mother for the spelling of the name \"Darrice?\"
If you were alone, I would have come up and said 'hi.'  
I'm getting so many weird emails from people so one question for you so that I know it's you:
What food were you eating that day? There was a specific fruit on the table, if you could also name me that, I'll know!
  
  
 tall asian guy, robarts 3rd floor reading room
 
to the asian guy who studied in the third floor robarts reading room all of second semester, our daily eye contact was pretty sweet. sorry i responded awkwardly when you wiggled your eyebrows at me. i know it's been a while, but wanna grab coffee sometime? 
i think you're around 6ft tall. you were constantly refilling some kind of protein shake water bottle. you dress nicely and occasionally wear glasses.
just so i know it's you, tell me what time of day you usually liked to study :)
sincerely, some asian girl.

 Knee Sox Mom Charging Phone - Jays Game Saturday
 
Hi! You had a great outfit on for a baseball game with your son. We were lined up behind you waiting to run the bases. I admit to thinking about you since our brief meeting. What was the tip I gave you? Hope to hear from you.
  
  
 Hey you Pikachu
 
I was walking down the street when you bumped into me. You looked up and our eyes met. The 2 seconds looking into your eyes felt like an eternity. But alas, you had to look back down and continue your quest. Too bad because you probably could have made me Squirt-le ;-P
  
  
 Downsview Station
 
I first noticed you when you were chatting with someone waiting for the bus.  I kinda wish we were able to chat because I'm attracted to you.  Your chiwawa was pretty cute as well.  Hopefully, I will bump into you again.
P.S.  Nice vase!
  
  
 Café Crepe - solo, staring, 4:30pm
 
Hi - not sure if it was intentional or you just didn't have anywhere else to look while you sat alone, but it felt like you were interested. 
This probably will lead to nothing, but I wanted to put something out there.

 You were from out of town, flighing out on friday
 
Hey we had a great time and I left something in your rental car.  We partied for the entire night.  Your flight was out at 4 and you would not tell me your last name.  Drop me a line and tell me where you are from so I know it's you and what was left in your car.
Cheers
  
  
 Josh With A Septum Ring
 
Does anyone know how to contact Josh? He had a septum piercing and probably mid 20s with brown hair. Fell out of contact but interested in hooking up.
  
  
 You're a great dancer
 
You were working at a club.  I was talking to an acquaintance and you stepped in.  You were very touchy feely with me, more than with anyone else.  I thought I was crazy or maybe she's just being nice.  You finished your shift and said good night to some people.  To my surprise you grabbed me and started to dance with me.  I asked you if you took salsa lessons because you knew what you were doing.
If you ever see this, and I highly doubt you will, let me know what club it was.
  
  
 Jays hat 510 Spadina Saturday night 1030pm

If you see this, tell me what I was wearing so I know it's you.

 Blue Jay game Friday Night
 
We struck up a conversation early Friday evening as we walked with our friend groups towards our gates to go in. You were wearing very light blue-jean shorts/shirt matching outfit, brunette, sweetest face, smile and wonderful disposition, kind, friendly, nice legs, small waist, terrific bust and just a complete package!! You had been in Oakville earlier at the Pro Men's Golf tournament. We got separated while walking and i've thought of you ever since....
  
  
 Second Cup
 
Hi, saw you while I was sitting on a bench outside Hero Burger today at 9 AM. I think you were coming from Second Cup and were taking a baked item (muffin?) out of a paper bag. You then sat on an adjacent bench behind me. After you finished you headed north on Bayview. I saw you again as I was heading home. Describe me and yourself. You're cute. Do you prefer muffin tops or bottoms

Hi there, we briefly spoke, wanted to apologize once again as I felt bad.

 Saturday Blue Jays game
 
I was standing near your section and noticed you. I was surprised by how you had my undivided attention immediately. 
We exchanged a few looks. I saw you later as you were leaving. I should have stopped and said more but you were with friends and I was caught off guard.
What did you say to me?
  
  
 Goodlife York and Wellington
 
Yesterday (Saturday 23 July) around 2:30 I came in good life while you had finished your workout and got ready to leave 
We both were watching the news but truth told I was there looking at you
I wish I had got a chance to talk but...
You are very handsome man in yours 40's may be 
Would love to talk to you and more 
Let me know if you remember anything particular so I know it's you
Hoping this to work
  
  
 Gorgeous Brunette on the late night bathurst bus heading north
 
You were the gorgeous brunette sitting across from me near the front of the bathurst bus early sunday/late saturday. I was holding cupcakes from a party we were holding and I was dressed in suit pants and a black shirt. I could tell you wanted to say hi but I guess you were too shy, I even smiled back at you. After you got off I saw you stop and look back at me on the bus and immediately regretted not getting off to at least talk to you and grab your number. If you happen to read this let me know what you were wearing at the time so I know it's you :)

 Citizen on King
 
I saw you for a few minutes inside. I should have talked to you but missed my chance. You left quickly and got into a cab while I stood there staring at you like an idiot.
I was wearing a pair of shorts and an orange Lacoste shirt. Tell me what you were wearing.
This is a long shot but better late than never.. Sorry I was such a pussy about things, I'm usually not so lost for words.
  
  
 Jean Vest at Bettys
 
Never posted here before, but hoping for the slimest chance at seeing you again...
You had on a jean vest w/ tattoos drinking with a buddy that had the same look. How do you manage in the heat?
I turned, & you winked at me. Wish I gave you my number... I had such a terrible date!
Here's to hoping I could buy you a drink sometime or see you again if you frequent Betty's.
If you remember anything about me, please reply back.
Cheers

 Murphys Law
 
Around 9pm this evening I was at Murphys Law on Queen st. East near Coxwell. You were my server, beautiful and bright with an Australian accent and curly long brown hair. I am a white male, 31 yrs old, about 6'1\". I was with an older friend, he had an Orange shirt on. We sat on the patio in the back, a table nearest the adjacent lane way. I thought you were the most beautiful girl. I would have asked you for your number right then, however given the rush from the Jazz  Festival I thought perhaps it was a bad time. My friend ordered a Spanish Coffee, you brought a regular Coffee and a shot of Whiskey:) You said it was the best you could do. I thought it was very sweet you tried. I would love nothing more than to have a drink with you. I hope this finds you.

 Toro y moi-so many details
 
The track- thanks vision is probably more suitable. Lolol
Hey u..,,.,
Drank for the first time in a week. Even then I only had three. I feel calm and happy. 
As I said the last time.....I'm so sorry about everything. It's so important to get this off my chest and to tell u how much I loved u deeply and it really wasn't either of our faults that I got PT..
If I was a pussy....I would have left my mom and ran out of the room and not stood by her side as she died. Instead I stood strong as I was taught and kept my integrity as a real man and worried about paying for it later. Man did I pay for it....lolol
With u....slowly after that, I couldn't love anymore..... I'm so so sorry. 
I didn't mean to be so cold. I was so very hurt. I wish u had the strength to had have grabbed me, hugged me and said k... Wake the fuck out of this funk. It's ok, I know u didn't have the strength or knowledge to help me. Doesn't matter now. I beat it. 👌🏻😘
It did matter so much at the time, but I woke up waaaaay too late. (about a year ago or so.)
Too bad for both of us. As I'm not to sure how much experience u have gained but once upon a time we had a deep passionate love. I still miss that a little bit. I don't miss always trying so hard to chear u up on the wk ends. U kept thinking ur life was so hard and were so negative. When I looked at ur life I knew u had more strength than u were exhibiting. I did....eventually lolol. Better late then never I guess for both of us. 
I hope u are happy. If u haven't faced ur shit than I know u can only be so happy. If u haven't yet I know u will one day. 
I hope u have not gained a bunch of weight and that u have been taking care of yourself. Thankfully I'm back to my old self in that way.....powerful and muscular. Sometimes a different thought about our passion we once had crosses my mind as I'm sure u remember how I felt when I'm in good shape. 😁 Lolol
I'll always miss u as a long lost love in the far distance that almost doesn't even seem like it really happened anymore. We both got pretty crazy in the end and kept trying to see who could hurt each other worse...lolol very stupid and immature on both our parts obviously.
I was gonna stop there, but I won't.....lol.
Listening to SUN ELECTRIC in the background with my headphones with big pup by my side.  The name of the album u heard frequently and kinda liked a few of the tracks as u mentioned is called -kitchens
Not sure if u care. It's certainly conducive to opening anyone's heart and or mind if u can get past how strange and unconformist it is. 
Some of it reminds me of u. Some of it reminds me of after finishing djing years ago and chillin after my set. 
I keep wanting to reiterate how sorry I am. I should have held ur heart so very softly in my hands instead of pushing u away. Probably was one of the top 3 hardest times in my life. Therefore loving u became secondary unfortunately. 
Pup is doing good, she loves our walks and plays with many neighbourhood kids. Still doesn't like dogs too much lolol. It's coming along slowly with gentle training. I can't imagine if we bumped into each other one day by the lake or something. Obviously I'm gonna avoid that like the plague at least for a few years anyway. However, I'm sure she would wine and cry out for u with deep love as I still try to never mention ur name cause I think it hurts her feelings. As to her.....she didn't do anything wrong to u to be hung out to dry from ur love towards her. Neither did B by the way. Certain people in my life thought that was really weird of u as they did nothing to deserve ur treatment of them. I tried to defend u cause I didn't want anyone....or myself to think that u were just a bad person. 
Considering how ur parents were so cold with u sometimes I guess I can understand how u could be like that. My mom had many problems but could never be as cold as u were treated by them. 
 I'll always still love u....I'll even love the big C in some ways forever. Lolol. I'm sure that's hard to understand. It is for me too, I guess I just can't hate anyone that I once loved. 
 Haven't seen B since September 2014. I'm sure u can imagine how that feels for him and me. I speak to him on the phone. She has complete control and has lost her mind, gained even more weight and won't let me see him. He was almost crying on the phone on Father's Day as he was trying to u understand why he can't see me. I'm very close to having the courts make her but it's taken sooooo long. 
Uhhhh.....u probably won't even see this...lololol
If u do, I know u. I'm sure u care less than I do. That's ok. Once upon a time u were focused, excitable, loving, passionate and in great shape. Those were the best times I will always remember. 
Do us both a favour and don't hold a grudge. It's not healthy.
U can if u wish obviously but I'm way past that now. 
Luv ya sweetness 
Take care. 
Tranquility 

  
  
 Tattooed Whitby woman in Parry Sound
 
On July 11th I saw you from across the produce section at Walmart and had to compliment your tattoos. You looked a bit shocked at first but I saw the ease in your eyes when you saw that I was attractive and not creepy. You told me that you were an hour away at Big Inn and I was only 20 minutes away, both of us on a weeks vacation. We spoke briefly about your tattoos and also about mine, too bad you were leaving right away or I could have showed you mine too. Please reply with what colour dress you were wearing that day and a little description of me and my tattoo. I hope to here from you.

 Dear Beautiful Woman
 
From the beginning of my life
 I have been looking for your face
 but today I have seen it
Today I have seen
 the charm, the beauty,
 the unfathomable grace
 of the face
 that I was looking for
Today I have found you
 and those who laughed
 and scorned me yesterday
 are sorry that they were not looking
 as I did
I am bewildered by the magnificence
 of your beauty
 and wish to see you
 with a hundred eyes
My heart has burned with passion
 and has searched forever
 for this wondrous beauty
 that I now behold
I am ashamed
 to call this love human
 and afraid of God
 to call it divine
Your fragrant breath
 like the morning breeze
 has come to the stillness of the garden
 You have breathed new life into me
 I have become your sunshine
 and also your shadow
My soul is screaming in ecstacy
 Every fiber of my being
 is in love with you
Your efflugence
 has lit a fire in my heart
 for me
 the earth and sky
My arrow of love
 has arrived at the target
 I am in the house of mercy
 and my heart
 is a place of prayer

  
  
 Looking To Interview For A Book
 
I am looking to interview people who have led a life of seemingly random events that have all come together to create the life they are living now.  My goal is to share other people's stories along with my own in an upcoming book.
It may have been some random course you took in college, something learned on a backpacking adventure, a book that you read which changed the direction of your life.  But life has a way of dropping gifts of knowledge when we don't expect it; and these things become invaluable information later on in life.
An example is a friend of mine who studied electronics.  He never worked a single day in that field.  Years later, he became a neurology teacher.  He said it was the easiest thing to do because the human nervous system is just a complex wiring diagram. This unique perspective made him a fabulous instructor.
These are the stories I'm looking to share.  Whether your experience is used directly in the book or not, you will receive a finished copy for your participation.
I look forward to meeting you and hearing your beautiful story.  Thank you in advance.

  
  
 You were jerkin it in UC basement washroom today
 
Title says it all.  I was in a suit. You had on a backpack and we're playing with your cock at the urinal.  I was too shy to come over and play but I want to. Hit me up.
  
  
 POWerful Legs!
 
You were blading along lakeshore  and I was biking when I complemented you on your legs. Your sexy af and  Would love to inspect them further and see just how powerful that third leg compares. I'm terrible I know ;)
What did you say as you passed by me ???   This way I know it's you.
  
  
 Morning Walk
 
You were walking east. I was walking west. Opposite sides of the street. We said hello and exchange niceties. You told me how you like walking in the heat. Would like to walk with you again. If you can describe the location of the city I am talking about then I will know it is you. You were wearing an orange/peach colour top and grey tights, sunglasses.
  
  
 Slipknot
 
You kept trying to get my attention towards the end of the show.

The tall curly haired waiter from Imanishi...I always pass by and look inside to see if you're working. You don't look like the type to read this bullshit but I'm hoping you have friends who do.
Grab a coffee with me?

 We talked in front of Dundas square stop over a year ago
 
I saw you while waiting for streetcar in front of Dundas square, you are a 22 year old Taiwanese female student and I, an older man. We talked about the fanatic preaching Jesus nearby and got on the streetcar together. I was to self conscious to ask for your contact. I regretted it since I thought we could have made good (if odd) friends!
  
  
 Dark and Lovely Stranger
 
Subway eastbound, I stood, you sat. Couldn't stop glancing at you, even before I spotted you spying me!
Gave you a simple smile and a nod on the way out.
You responded with the most beautiful grin and bright smiling eyes. 
Have to say made my night. 
Thought you should know.
Be well.

  
  
 Cancelled streetcar, cute girl, King street west and Jefferson avenue
 
It was around 1 30 AM in the night, I was waiting for the King street car going west towards Dundas west station (at King street west and Jefferson, before Joe Shuster way), which all of a sudden didnt come, based on my app. It went from arriving at 1 minute to 20 mins.
I gave up and waived at a cab. You were walking and as you came closer you said, are you waiting for the street car, they dropped us all at Shaw street and told us to walk, there is not going to be any street cars toward west.  You were wearing a beautiful sandal coloured dress with a cute smile.
We chatted for a bit, you were very cute, polite and friendly, which is very rare in Toronto :D
While we chatted the cab I called stopped near me, and I said have a good night to you, but as the cab moved, I realized I should have offered you to have you dropped off on the way, I didnt offer. 
I thought it would be inappropriate, and you are incredibly cute so I thought it might look inappropriate as you might mistake me for offering.
Eitherways, I really should have offered you the ride considering how late it is, and on the way there was a crime scene with cop taped all over a block away which is why the street cars were cancelled. 
I feel terrible that I didnt offer, not sure how far you were going to have to walk, since the whole area looked deserted and it was unexpected.
I also noticed you thought I ended the chat abruptly as the cab came stopped near me. 
If you are reading this, drop me a message.
  
  
 Jeremy D. at Pemberton Music Festival
 
You rescued my hat and the rest is either history or a dream; I can't tell which. I know you're back in Ontario so it's unlikely you'll see this. If you do, I hope you respond. I would love to talk to you again.
  
  
 you're gonna lose her forever
 
If you don't change SOMETHING, she's gonna leave. It's starting to happen already and soon it will be too late. You want to be scarce in every way, well, she's not texting you much anymore either. Soon it will stop completely.
You can change your wants, your daily actions, lots of things you can do differently. Keep up the same way as now, and you will lose someone who you are taking a lot from and not giving anything in return.
  
  
 Ghosted?
 
We haven't spoken in about a week, and you never replied to the text I sent you over the weekend.
Was it something I said
Well whatever it is it can't be that bad because you haven't unfollowed me on Instagram. 
Which means I can't unfollow you because then I look petty. 
Ugh! Your dog was cooler than you anyway.

 Cyclist seeking driver/driver's gf in a collision
 
We were in an accident yesterday morning around 9:00am. You did the right thing and stopped. I was in shock and didn't get your info. I thought the officer on scene was supposed to do that, but because I didn't take an ambulance he may not have to file a report. I'm hoping he has your info and am following up with the TPS to check that out. I filed a report at the collision reporting centre. I'm feeling better than yesterday and hope I don't have more serious injuries, but just in case something develops, I hope to get your information. Thank you very much for the ride home, and you said you wanted to do the right thing. If by chance this gets to you, I hope you reach out.

 Studying at school
 
We were both studying in the main building at school. I couldn't help to notice that we were making eye contact constantly, while doing so. You were working on some powerpoint and i was seating at a desk close to you. I didn't come up to talk to you because i didn't know if you were into guys or not. Hit me up if you are! Send me a reply and tell me what i was wearing, that way i'll know is you.

 Blue haired pokemon girl
 
Me: blue bike, glasses, dirty blonde hair in a half-bun, black t-shirt, orange backpack  
You: a qt with long blue hair
Saw you playing Pokemon Go at high park last night around 9:30 or 10. We followed each other down Bloor on our bikes, stopping at lures along the way, until you disappeared into/around a McDonald's. I wanted to ask you if you wanted to take over some gyms with me but I'm a nerd who plays Pokemon Go so I'm talking to the internet instead. Attached image is me.

Hey i was sitting across from you you had a hat (Red and Black) I think we made i contact and few times and a few smile. I was to shy to say anything. But you are hot, Also you were wearing a blue shirt and black jeans. Wish i said something though im a little wild when i want to be but would have loved to go to your place and give you a blow job. :P
  
  
 It was all about baseball....
 
It was probably 6-7 yrs ago...you answered my ad which was littered with baseball clichés......and you answered in kind......we met for a drink....it was electric, might have to do with the fact we were both tasting forbidden fruit....couldn't keep our hands off each other....it ended with a Grand slam home run.......have no idea why we stopped keeping in touch, but I do know the parting was cordial.........if this rings any kind of bell with you......step up to the plate....it is your turn to bat :)
  
  
 re:Words are meaningless
 
any initials as to who these stories are for? Did you write these stories for someone else? I think I may be losing my mind a little. Truth is I'm not keen on games nor am I a fan of them. I'll leave you alone.
  
  
 Bm You used to be my everything.
 
We were fireworks. Every where we went people lit up with energy complemented us always smiling and happy at least that's what I want to remember. I know I fucked up but I'm good please let's make this work. 
Please man.

 Uber Driver looking for Rider who stole my heart
 
I know this is a long shot but a year ago, as the Panam games were rapping up I drove you home from a bachlorette party. It was for your brother's fiance who was set to get married in September. I asked you if you attended any of the Panam games and you said you didn't.
This is my second attempt at posting this because the fir one seems to have vanished.
I know you're not single (or at least you weren't then) but I thought you were pretty awesome and I just want to hang out and do some cool stuff with you as friends. It's not everyday you meet someone you click well with and it frustrates me that once I found someone like that I lost contact with you and never saw you again.
I tried to contact you after I drove away but the number had already been re-routed.

 Beyond the Vanity of Things
 
When I try to find friends, it seems that most ladies and gentlemen are looking for people to play sports with, go to bars with, go drinking with, attend concerts with, hang out at coffee shops with.
Is this a disorder when you need physical things to keep yourself occupied and plugged into the relationships that you have with others?
What interests me are words. I long to find friends who don't want to go to the festival or the museum or the art gallery but instead, just want to talk to each other about how their day went.
Is that so much to ask? Is there anybody who wants a real friendship or relationship built around conversation and not around food, music, clothes, sports, hair or make up?
  
  
 Winners at Burlington mall
 
I saw you at the Winners at Burlington mall today 20th July in early evening.  You are a tall caucasian female with short blonde hair ... curvy body, I am not sure but you seemed to be pregnant ... I hope you don't mind my saying this.  I was very attracted by you, but I am shy around women, so I did not say Hi to you ... I should have.
I am brown male, 47 years, 5'-11\ non-smoker, disease & drug free. You glanced towards me a couple of times, so I think I am ok to look at.
Let mew know if you would like to meet up & chat. It is Ok if you are attached.
  
  
 What is that even like?
 
I'm 40, tall, fit, good-looking. Decent, dependable, reliable. Married. A good father. A good provider.
What is like to still be wanted by your wife? For her to still be interested in sex? To still have passion?
What is that even like?
Do you leave? Do you break up your kids' home just because you are sexually unfulfilled? What kind of selfish asshole would do that?
Friends of ours talk about their great sex lives. And it's like they're speaking a foreign language that I just don't understand. And I've talked to my wife about it and yet nothing. 
I work incredibly hard. I look after my family. I don't drink. I don't spend time away from my family with hobbies. I have, really, no vices or sources of pleasure.
I've gone the longest I have without sex since I lost my virginity. Years.
But obviously this isn't the case for everyone.
What is that like?
(A different sort of missed connection, admittedly. The kind that happens after marriage.)

 i miss making love
 
I so miss making love to someone who truly wants me... Its been a year but I still miss kissing you and tasting you and holding you close.  I miss the sounds you make.  I miss feeling bodies pressed together. I just want to meet one more time and pleasure you.
  
  
 Young, Handsome Indian man NB Line One (Eglington Stn around 6:30pm)
 
You caught my eye once again. Today I was lucky enough to see you again, you wore a navy, dark blue turban on the line 1 train going northbound to Finch at around 6:30pm today. (July 20th)
You're tall, handsome, and wear a turban every time I see you. You carry a light brown leather bag with you also.
You often get on at Eglington and travel northbound on weekday evenings. Usually around 6-7pm. I get off at Sheppard/Yonge. Even though I can only briskly see you from time I time I hope that one of these days it isn't so packed on the train so that I'll have the chance to say hi. 
Here's to hoping,
Shy girl on line one.
  
  
 We smiled as i was boarding a train at union this evening
 
I've never posted one of these before, but here it goes..
We smiled at each other a few times as I was in line, boarding a VIA train this evening. You were busy and I didn't get a chance to say hi. 
If this is you (and if you are inclined to say hi), tell me what kind of shirt I was wearing? Would love to meet for coffee sometime.
  
  
 Can women really squirt ?
 
Wondering if they really can...if you or someone you know, does I would like to know. I think it is sexy and would love to hear about it.

  
  
 Beautiful woman in green dress!
 
You had balck hair and you were carrying a shopping bag. I was going by on my bike and I was completely distracted. Could have hit a pole. You're gorgeous! Just wanted to make your day. Have a lovely summer!

Past affair...
We are both good looking and attached.  It's long overdue that we start up again, our affair, me servicing you in ways you could never get at home.  There's no way you could possibly be happy without my lips...wrapped around your c0ck.  A warm and wet mouth always ready and willing.  We've both proven our trust to not affect our respective lives;  still the same deal.  Please get back to me, I miss you.Hints: I promise we'll have that threesome.  West end.  1st facial.

 Cherry Beach/Regatta Road

You were wearing White Adidas running shoes, black athletic shorts and a white t-shirt. 
Silver,white hear, facial hair, 5'8-ish, great build. Older, 40s, but so sexy. 
We made out and fooled around a bit. 
You were an awesome kisser and get hard thinking about it. 
I was wearing a black t-shirt, black chucks, black baseball cap, tan shorts n had a backpack. 
You mentioned you lived in the East end and would love to connect again if you happen to see this.

  
  
 saw you walking down queen w
 
i saw you all at once - the sidewalk parted for you and it was almost too slow to be real: your dark eyes lifting from your phone briefly. you gave me the smallest of smirks knowing i was looking at you but you didn't seem to mind; i saw that dimple.
 i thought i smelled your cologne as you passed and caught a glimpse of the back of your neck. i looked back hoping you would too but lost you in the crowd.. tell me what type of jacket i was wearing so i can find you again sinderella
  
  
 A short elevator ride
 
You: a blonde woman in a grey dress who opened the door for me. You caught the elevator for us and said that people should do these things for each other. You were funny and charming, and I should have said so.
  
  
 uber guy from downtown to yyz

So here i am trying to connect again and see if we can grab a coffee or drink and continue our discussion lol. Your name start from P and mine from S. You were going to your cousin's in us. I hope to catch you again sometime. You went from Elizabeth Street to yyz. 
Cheers

 Fresh Produce!
 
You instantly caught my eye across the organics, then dashed off after a beautiful smile. Our paths crossed again a few aisles over. A few awkward glances later you paid and left, I remained grocery basket in hand, wishing I had approached you.
You are so lovely. Dark hair, slender though curvy, light skin, big beautiful eyes, and that smile, damn!

 most beautiful man bun of toronto (centre island ferry employee)
 
I'm in search of the name /contact of the most beautiful man I came across during my vacation weekend in Toronto. He was operating the Centre Island Ferry on Saturday July 16th in the late afternoon. He is tall, olive skin, pierced ears and has a beautiful man bun. Most like late 20s/early 30s. See posted photo for reference. Any information welcome. 
If this delicious man is reading this, I was the tall brunette in a wide-brimmed hat that asked you when the last ferry was. :-)

Thank you,

 Played with you in steam room at goodlife
 
This was a while ago, but we eyed each other in the sauna for a while. You stood directly in front of me, letting me watch your bulge underneath the towel. When we were alone in the steam room, we played with each other. You were really into it. But you got nervous because your boyfriend was also at the gym. I asked you if he wanted to join us. And you said maybe. 
Didn't want to get you in trouble, so I left pretty abruptly. But I noticed you hung around for a little too long after I was dressed, lol. So I'm guessing you were hoping I'd come back. 
Me: fit Asian jock
You: fit white dude
Roughly same ages
Tell me which location this was at and/or guess my age/tell me something about me or you. Maybe we can recreate it.

 Blue haired creature - Riot Fest 2014, Toronto, Rebel stage
 
You were the first thing I spotted the second I got to the Rebel stage. It was impossible to not notice you. Your hair was shinning boldly under the sun, your enthusiasm was contagious. You spent a lot of time in the moshpit, having the time of your life. After Radkey's set, you came close to the gate to shake their hands. Your attitude was incredible. And your smile. Damn, that smile. It was simply radiant. Same goes for the blue hair dancing on your forehead, right over your mischievous twinkling eyes. I tried paying attention to the bands playing on stage, to the rest of the crowd, my boyfriend next to me... ...but my eyes always came back to you. I was fascinated. Couldn't look away.

You were alone. The concept of someone going alone to a festival was completely insane for me, at the time. The thought of having to go somewhere unaccompanied used to cripple me. But after seeing you, everytime I started feeling uneasy because of this, you would come to my mind. I remembered how you were having such a blast. Living in the moment. And instantly it made me feel so much better. Serene. Eventually I started going out more. And more. Even travelling in faraway cities, which I never thought I would find the balls to do by myself. I've seen and experienced a lot of wonderful things this past year, things I would have normally declined or ignored because I was too afraid. Didn't take long to realize that I'd much rather tag along a crowd of people that are really having fun than to feel stuck with someone wishing to be somewhere else, complaining. I used to think that only people that nobody liked had to be by themselves. But I doubt that such a charismatic guy like you was there alone because nobody cared about him. Seeing you changed my whole perspective. I stopped being so goddamn judgmental. And my life has been so much easier since.

Speaking of judgment, I finally dyed my hair purple. I've been dreaming about it for such a long time, rebel colors having fascinated me for years. I thought you looked incredible with your blue hair. So maybe I could look amazing in purple. You've given me the courage to stop caring about what people might think and to just go along with it. And I absolutely love it. I've even had a lot of strangers just walk up to me and tell me they like it. My confidence has increased so much since I've embraced it and I have absolutely no regret about finally taking the plunge.

And I've realized that it is much better to try and talk to someone at the risk of looking stupid than not being able to grasp the moment when it came. We didn't talk, that day. I'm sad that I wasn't confident enough to just come up and talk to you. Ask for your name. Tell you how much you made me smile all day. Of course at the time I didn't know how you would eventually leave such a huge positive impact in my life. But I've rarely felt such admiration for a stranger. I should have known that your memory would haunt me once I'd be home. The way I shivered when your arm brushed mine as you were regaining the crowd after bodysurfing. And how you rendered me completely breathless the one time your eyes locked on mine as we passed by.

I wouldn't call this a missed connection. You've given me a lot in the little time that you were in my line of sight, more than most people gave me in my whole life. Maybe you've already opened my eyes to everything I had to learn from you. But I can't help but wonder... ...if you've made my life so much better in just a few hours, how far could you take me?
  
  
 sharing glances and smiles (subway)
 
I hope this works. This Monday 18 around 6:00 pm I toke the subway in Sheppard-Yonge. I was with my brother and you were in front of me. You were wearing glasses and I was wearing a cap . We were sharing glances and smiles. You are very cute. You left the train in Bloor Yonge. I would like to meet you. If you see this please send me  email and tell me the color of my cap or shirt :)

  
  
 Blond woman, short skirt, on 506 Streetcar, Gerrard east
 
We were on streetcar 506 eastbound Monday afternoon around 1:45pm.
I don't remember where you got on, but you sit nearby, beside my plastic bags
and you commented that the food smelled good.
Tell me what I said in response.
You are pretty. I like you :) ,you are a cheerful person.. and hope you see this msg.
You got off near Woodbine.. wish I had said something..

  
  
 I just can't
 
Can't believe I let you play me with your pathetic sad life story. I was nothing but willing to talk to you, be there for you but I guess I wasn't good enough. Messaging me in the middle of the night because you think I'm sleeping so we don't have to actually have a conversation, yet you go how many days deep to respond to an ad at 5 am to talk to someone.. that someone was me you idiot. You know exactly who you are and I know you're gonna read this. Maybe the reason people don't check up on you is because they can see through your fakeness. I'd say good luck with your life, but I don't care.

met you at holiday inn yorkdale wirlpool,
You told me you were a pilot .  I think you are good looking. And \\i think you wanted to ask me but you left.  I am really interested if you want to email me.
  
  
 i still dream about you
 
You havent changed a bit.
I love seeing you in my dreams. 
And love it even more when you see me.

  
  
 In the Pit at The Coathangers
 
You are tall, with long dark hair and dyed blonde tips. You were in the pit for The Coathangers, the band shirt tired around your torso evidence of your dedication to the band, and I often found myself watching you instead of them. You were having the most fun of anyone in the venue, and I would like to get to know you a bit better. Maybe drinks? Or maybe a show?
Me: taller than you, black shorts, black tee, blue collared shirt. Tell me my hair colour and if I have a beard or not.
Talk soon :)
  
  
 Can we go back to the start...
 
JASE, when I sit alone in the stillness I begin to question why you aren't next to me after all this time.. 
Our circumstances may be unusual and stakes may be high, but if you don't take a chance there is and will forever be what if's. 
Stop giving me the cold shoulder, talk to me.
I miss you.

 We shared a smile as I rode by
 
I rode passed the most beautiful women ever today..and you shared a smile with me!  I was on the bike by the lakeshore..just west of the CNE sometime between 5-5:30 pm ..and you were walking off to the side wearing a bright pink top.  We both smiled instantly..and I feel the need to speak to you.  I didn't stop cuz I'm a bit shy..but I regret it very much now.  Anyways..I know this is a long shot..but what the heck lol  If you see this please respond ☺
  
  
 Sheppard station thick black hair
 
I saw you at Sheppard station today at around 5ish. You were stunning with long black thick hair, nose ring, wearing a black dress and had a backpack.
I have never felt so electrified by a women. I eventually sat next to you and you got off at Queen. I just kept smiling at you, I didn't know what to say.
If you see this I would love to hear from you.
  
  
 Thank you for letting me give you a HJ in the sauna
 
I complimented you on your stunning young asian body when I saw you in the sauna earlier today.  I had noted that you barely kept your ass and cock covered by your towel when you stood in front of me.  Also you wore glasses, implying that you wanted to be able to see well.  So I had figured my compliment might inspire you to show me more.  Before I knew it you flashed me your lovely cock.  I complimented it and asked if I could touch it.  soon, you pushed my hand away.  But then you reached over for my cock and played with it for awhile.  So... I reached over again to fondle you... you laid back and enjoyed it for a bit but a second time you pushed my hand away.  I asked you... \"did I hurt you\". You said \"no... I was just about to cum\".
At that point, I said to you... \"I'd love to make you cum.  Can I bring you off?\"
Then you nodded, stood up and before me, exposed your entire naked body to me while I gently tugged on your un-cut penis.  You started breathing deeply and then I felt your cock throb in my hand followed by an nice warm goo covering my fingers.  By this time, the heat was un-bearable, so we both left... but on your way out, you said thank you to me.
I wanted to tell you that it is I who should thank you.  It was truly an honour that you let me enjoy your amazing hot body and that I was able to pleasure you and make you cum.  If you'd ever like more, I'd welcome the opportunity.
David.
  
  
 Bald bearded bear - University line this morning
 
You'll never see this, but it's cathartic posting here...You're a bald bear with a big, full beard. You were on the University subway line this morning, and exited at St. Andrews station around 9:40am. I attempted eye contact several times, but you were very interested in your phone, and barely looked up lol. 
Anyway, I just had to post here to say what a sexy mofo you are. Woof! I hate that expression, but it really does apply here... :)
  
  
 trinity bellwoods smile
 
i was walking 2 dogs early saturday morning through trinity and you were walking with a cat in a travel kennel.  you smiled at me as we passed and it picked me up before i grabbed a much needed coffee. made my morning..... here's to smiling at strangers! :)
  
  
 I saw you at Connorvale Park
 
My dog discovered you at the equipment she'd after work. Had myself a good laugh. If that was you get back to me!
  
  
 Brown hair, black dress on the Yonge subway
 
I got on the Yonge subway today at College station going north.  You were sitting down on the train.  You had long light brown hair, brown eyes, and a black dress on.  I was standing across from you on the train.  I was tall, short brown hair, beige coloured shorts and a light blue t-shirt.  I thought you were quite pretty.  Then both of us got off at Yonge station at about 2:15 and walked up the stairs into the mall.  I was behind you for a little while until I passed by.  As I said, I found you quite attractive.  Maybe you'll see this.
  
  
 Nicole from Bathroom Stall
 
You left your name on the bathroom stall in the downstairs women's bathroom at Bar 244 on Adelaide St. The picture read \"NICOLE poop\ encircled by a beautiful heart, with faint background scribbles saying \"even if it hurts, I love you\". 
I knew from the second I laid eyes on your handwriting that it was meant to be. No one else could possibly understand my love of pooping (even when it's painful) like you. So, Nicole Poop, if you're out there, your soulmate Kevin Hastopoo will forever be waiting for your response. Xoxo #hastopoo
  
  
 Def Leopard and sexy woman

 Dufferin Bus Driver o_0
 
Had to give this a try... You were driving the 29 bus down Dufferin, I saw you pull up and thought you were handsome, just another face to admire... Then when I was grabbing my transfer I felt a good vibe... When I got off the bus you told me to have a good day and it caught me by surprise... Your vibe helped start that good day... Thank you mystery bus man, I hope to see you again and if not the vibe still rocks!!!... I was wearing red shoes ;)

 \"It's all yours now\" -King st. Subway platform+train, Sunday July 17
 
Long shot but why not?!
Sunday July 17th, around 5-5:30 pm. 
We were both on the King St. platform for the northbound train. We got on the train and I sat down to find a token and 5 cents left on the seat - you saw and said \"It's all yours now\" and I smiled at you. 
You got off at Bloor station and looked through the windows at me as the train went on... You should have said Hi. 
You're tall, maybe 6'2\"-3\ slim build, wore beige shorts and light beige slip on shoes, a hat, short hair, a black backpack and your head phones. 
I wore black sunglasses, a black tank-top, black open sweatshirt, light blue jeans, and ballet slippers. I have long brown hair, slim, 5'7\ black purse and white headphones. 
We smiled at one another... 

  
  
 Daddy Cocksucker walking thru the park.
 
Daddy Cocksucker here looking to explore Withrow Park at night with a guy with a load for me. A son would be nice, but not absolutely necessary.
I will be walking around and have my phone with me, so you can message me. I expect to arrive there around 11 pm.
Only discovered this place a few days ago and haven't been there at night yet. But depending on how well various places are or are not illuminated, it should make for an interesting and worthwhile walk.
No, I am not willing to be generous.
Care to smoke a reefer with me and see what we can find?
I'm in my 50s, handsome, average height and fit. I am a bottom, as well, but let's take this one step at a time.

 You were at Def Leppard in a GNR shirt
 
You were with two friends, I was with one. (I was the one in white with the purple hair). You were wearing a GNR shirt and I thought you were cute.  I wondered if you regretted missing the GNR show. (I did. Despite how much I love Def Leppard, GNR is definitely a bucketlist concert). Wanted to come talk to you afterward. We were all sitting around in the same row for a while after the concert was over but I couldn't find the right words to break the ice and your friends eventually got tired of waiting. 
If you (or your friends) happen to read this... tell me what section we were in! I'm looking for a concert buddy for Disturbed in August. :)
  
  
 shirtless on the waterfront trail
 
You were walking west, black shorts no shirt. I was with a man walking east. We met eyes, you smiled... I know you somehow....
  
  
 A Thousand Years
 
A thousand years, a thousand more, 
A thousand times a million doors to eternity 
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs 
To a tower of souls 
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars, 
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths,
A million names but only one truth to face
A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs,
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame,
The single haunted memory of your face 
I still love you 
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves 
Like galaxies in my head
I may be numberless, I may be innocent 
I may know many things, I may be ignorant 
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands 
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times 
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes 
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief 
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief
I still love you 
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves 
Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves 
Eternities still unsaid 
'Til you love me
  
  
 Where is Dixie?
 
I approached you and your family to ask which side of the mall Dixie was on..I was a little lost lol  You had red hair and commented on my tattoo.  You were incredibly attractive..I can't get you out of my mind.   I know this is a long shot..but if you see this give me a shout ☺
  
  
 ATJAZZ.....not in vain
 
Only u would understand that heading. 
Not sure if u may ever see this. 
I never want either of us to look back on the love we once had in vain. 
Met my rasta friend b4 writing this....sessssss. Had to be direct about that first. I feel so full of acceptance and love. At the same time Listening to toro and John Beltran. 
Can't believe how that all happened with us. 
It feels so stupid now. I'm so very sorry. I had always loved u like my beautiful princess.  I know I found it hard to show that but that's really how much I loved u. I really could imagine getting old with us both in a rocking chair one day with grand kids running around. How profoundly incredible and beautiful that would have been. 
I know that when I started caring about myself less, u did so also. It's ok, I understand that I really didn't give u much reason to love me anymore. For that I will always be sorry. 
I know u may be contacted by a Ms. M about the situation. Do what u must. I swear I am not writing u this because of that. 
Despite having a 6mnth relationship since we broke up and a few dates with other woman. I LOVE U.
Fuck, I'm glad I just spat that out. I may erase all of this b4 u read it. If u do read it....only u would know all of what I'm referring to. 
I really hope u have found love.......I thought I did but it was not like our passionate love when we were getting along and close. 
I kinda hope u don't read this because I probably will never post something like this to u ever again.
U were like a flower that quickly rised up for me in a sea of darkness. Ur love had the ability to calm my intensity and dominance. When u would grab me and calm me down when I wanted to teach someone a lesson when we were out and about and my intensity grabbed me. I will always love that about u. Ur heart and love for me (at one point in Time could calm me instantaneously.) 
I love u like the desert creatures love rain. I'll always love u so very deeply. We will probably never lay eyes on each other again, especially because of what u did. It's too bad. We know each other so well we probably could have been great friends. 
The main reason I was thinking of u today is that I had a dream about us last night.....we were on a dance floor, dancing really close and so connected to one another. I held ur head so softly to pull u towards me with a kiss full of passion and fireworks. It felt so good. The smell of ur hair, ur soft dante touch and then grabbing ur hips to pull u in so close that we were one as I kissed u intensely but ever so softly. 
I don't think about u as much as I used to but that dream really threw me off today. It reminded me that it's all my fault and I'm so sorry. I just wanted u to know that. If we never see each other again in which we probably won't. I just want u to know that I loved u so very much and it took me so long to wake up from the pt.. That I have only recently realized the incredible love we once had. 
I truly wish u the best. I'm sure I will dream of our love on and off forever. As that's how much u meant to me. 
For I can only ask one thing from u????? Please don't be mad at me? I'm sorry it all fell apart after my mommy died. I never meant to let my pain control me......I'm so sorry. 
I'll always love u so very deeply. 

  
  
 David...
 
I am woman of many words who is learning to speak just a few. You see, a relationship is not just one person speaking all the time, but rather a loving discourse between two people.
I really want to get to know you. The real you. Not the one that maybe I imagined you to be, what others believe you to be or the one you yourself need to be in order to be successful at what you do. I want to know your heart. I want to speak authentically with you minus all the rubbish type discourse that I no longer find to be worthy nor compatible with my renewed spiritual life. Depth in conversation is what I long for with you.
I believe we have a lot to learn about and from each other. It is regrettable the lengths that outside parties have gone to in order to create confusion and misunderstanding with regard to one another. They have sown the seed of doubt in my mind with regard to your motivations and intentions to the degree that I am mistrustful of you. Yet, I pray for clarity in this regard....and peace. 
I am drawn to you by a force only God himself us capable of... Love. I am in your heart and you are in mine. Some beautiful things are happening in your life and mine right now. I'd love for you to be the first to know about them. My door is open, but it is up to you to take the first steps through its threshold.
Love always
J

So, I assume you live in the neighbourhood?  I'll keep an eye out, perhaps a chat over a drink at the place I ran in to you?
  
  
 Flight attendant on the UP at bloor station
 
I was really hoping you would get off at Union so I might have had a chance to say a little more than how's it going.  Stunning.
  
  
 TTC penguins
 
You'd say in front and with next to no time before my stop I said \"Nice penguins\" 
Your response was a simple \"Thanks\" and big smile.  I had to leave and said \"Have a great day\"
I wished that we'd had more time to chat and you could tell me the story of those cute penguins on your left shoulder.
  
  
 Hot dude at Guns N Roses last night..
 
You were tall with longish dirty blonde hair. We chatted while in line for beers about the girl who passed out near us and about the slow service. You invited me and my male friend to sit next to you but you vanished. You're hot! Do you remember me? If it's you tell me what section you sat in (saw you later a few rows down from me!)
  
  
 beautiful girl from Bloke lastnight
 
Good morning and this I know will be a long shot...
I haven't been to a downtown club in a very long time and lastnight went out with a bunch of friends to Bloke Nightclub. Very nice place I must add, and a lot of beautiful ladies, BUT you were one that stood out to me and we made eye contact number of times and smiled.. I really wanted to talk to you, but you were with your boyfriend I think? Anyhow you poked me when you walked by me :). Hope this makes its way safely to you :)
  
  
 when it starts to feel
 
Like ur gone
This morning it felt that way
Feel so sad
Still have tears for u
So worried about u
I want to see u again
  
  
 Any local women wanna hit the slopes with a talented licker?
 
I have some white stuff. And what I really like to do with that is find a local woman to share it with. And after that, as you repose on your bed or your couch or the kitchen floor, we both enjoy a nice, long session of blessed cunnilingus.
I don't have any particular traits in mind. Older and younger, thinner and plumper, white, brown, black, whatever. Each is appealing in its own special way.
So really, the one variable that really matters here is that this appeals to you.
Looking for now, but if you're interested and now is not good, let's chat. And absolutely willing to meet for coffee or a drink or a game of bowling beforehand if you prefer.
Looking for within a long walk from Danforth and Pape. You host.
I am 58 years old, 5 feet 7 inches and 160 lbs. Sexy, handsome and by now, I really do know what I'm doing. 
Might be willing to do this on an ongoing basis (although so far as the white stuff goes, let's just say that it's hard to predict when it's going to snow.), but let's just start with this once for now.
  
  
 tThinking I can, but I can't
 
Willed into fate
Lov is my singular
She is my reason
Thoughts of any other is like my heart committing treason
Honesty and devotion
Swearing strictly on emotion
She is all I can see
She is beauty in motion
I'm losing myself
Lost in an elevator only going down
It's her voice..  that is my favourite sound
Translating an inclination.. waiting it thru 
I am here, undignified. looking where I pass
Questioning questions long since past
Thinking I can, but I can't
Willed into fate
Lov is my singular
She is my reason
Thoughts of any other is like my heart committing treason
shmOooOoOooOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

 Ukranian girl at the pilot in yorkville

 tall, tattooed blonde at Coathangers show tonight
 
This is a bit weird since I only watched you from a distance... was hoping to see you after but everyone dispersed pretty quick.
You were tall, dressed in black with tattoos and dyed blonde hair. You arrived to get a good spot for the Coathangers and you kept your hands in the air for most of the show and I loved seeing you everytime the arms went up and you caught my eyes. I was further back but just wanted to say you made the show so much more fun... would have loved to buy you a drink.
  
  
 Subway around 1 am east from ossington
 
As the only subway cars with AC seem to be ones where a ttc employee is I made my way to the one with the conductor operating the doors. When I got in I stood at the doors as I was tired and sitting might of enticed me to sleep. A few minutes passed and then I noticed the cutest girl sitting just infornt of me on the opposite side. You have black hair and were wearing a shirt with a British flag on it and black pants, you also wear glasses. This was around 1 am going east bound, we both got on at ossington station and you got off at coxwell.
I was standing at the doors also wearing glasses, in a blue and white button up shirt. Sadly my stop was past coxwell.
As the situation stood, it would have been awkward to aproach, and getting off at your stop to say hi... well that would of just been creepy lol.
If you read this, and I very much doubt you do, lets grab a coffee, I owe you a hello. =]
  
  
 Cute beard guy from Guns N' Roses - Section 524B
 
Totally wanted to chat after the show, but we went separate ways! 
We were sitting beside each other for a bit but then the people took their seats back. I was in seat 109.  
Your beard was 100% better. 
What shoes was I wearing? / What shoes were you wearing!
  
  
 ... Hold on to life... ;)
 
Where has the love gone? I don't know... two weeks ago I was good but now feel like I have no flow...
Do I stay? Should I \"keep\" living how I have been? Will I slip till I fall bang my head on to a bin
I can't go on like this!!! Pull your ass up! I, I, I... know I feel I can't take on another day of being stuck!
If that's the case this means you gotta change it! If things are shit you must rearrange it, maybe even fake it till you make it.
Parties in the moment of course feel so good, not bein' in the hood and with my crowd we're understood...
But, as everyone slowly leaves and I return back to my room... that's when my reality I don't express to others takes over soon...
Fuck\" I drank too much, or at least enough for me to feel pretty high, but will be suicidal tomorrow... \"is that a knife? Can I borrow?\" I'll shake it all off the day after tomorrow!
This ain't me, I'm better than this, \"yea\" the kiss... of death is near though I'm not ready but at the same time there is no fear...
Life... beautiful life is beyond these feelings I obviously cannot positively profit from... So, I guess I'll ride this out set myself to get up instead of setting with the sun...

  
  
 You asked me if I worked here
 
You asked me if I worked there. You didn't really think I did, I don't think, but asked anyway. you looked back and smiled a couple of times. Once, I waved.
  
  
 Streetcar - Spadina and Dundas
 
I saw you on the streetcar as the driver accelerated and almost tried to kill you lol.
We had a couple chuckles and I got off at Spadina and Dundas and we smiled at eachother and made more eye contact.
You had blonde hair and sat beside me.
I know this is a long shot but you were incredibly sexy. 

  
  
 Rooster cafe (Broadview) then Big Carrot
 
You've been alone sitting at the bench in Rooster cafe (Broadview) around 5 p.m. Late 40s I woud say tall, dark hair, blue distinguish eyes, very British look. I was with friends (yonge married couple with 2 small noisy kids) just in front of you. Later, 6:15 around, I saw you (you didn't see me) in Big Carrot.
Would like to know you better.
  
  
 In line at Dollarama JUNE 30th
 
We made eye contact multiple times when I walked in as you were in line then I ended up behind you when I was ready.  We chatted in line about our dogs until you got to the register to pay. I was hoping you would be lingering outside waiting for me to exit.... but you were gone.  
Tell me what I bought or what I was wearing.  Maybe we should have a play date with the dogs over coffee?
You were a construction guy wearing one of those fluorescent t-shirts with the reflective X.
  
  
 Guy who cut my hair
 
Hi.  You cut my hair today and I thought you were so hot.  You told me about getting used to our cold weather and asked me about my plans this summer.  I could definitely have a better summer if you are in it!  Get in touch if interested!
  
  
 Thank you so much for the compliment
 
I was near Parliment and King street East waiting for the TTC bus towards Castle Frank station.  I am the tall large jacked looking brown guy. You and your girlfriend or your friend who is a girl were in the car, stopped by the signal light and out of the blue complimented me that, dude you look like a beast up there! I did not expect that, she gave me a smile and thumbs up. You guys made my day and I did not expect that at that moment, did not thank you enough. Since I was working indoor in the past few weeks, I wasn't that social and couldn't come up with a response on the spot, you kind of picked up on that and told me, don't take the shirt off and make us all look bad.
I really appreciate your compliment brother, you were equally fit, I am very thankful for the confidence boost. 
I had a harsh injury on my foot year ago and gained so much of fat of non activity and other life stuff. But got tired of that and woke up from that mess and been religiously working hard to get back in the shape and sort of there. Your compliments motivated me that hard works  pays off and I am on the right track. Anyone who were in my shoes can relate to this. I don't know if you will ever read this, but we need more friendly people like you. 
Thanks again!

  
  
 Let me go down on you, and we go from there
 
I prefer women of all sizes. I'm only really interested in a mindset of having fun and enjoying the moment. May seem cliché, but hey, there are only so many ways to describe something as simple as sex.
  
  
 Corner of Yonge and College
 
About 9:45/10PM last night, July 17, I got on the 506 bus westbound and I saw a 5'10/6'0 guy checking me out, I checked him out and when he noticed he waved and smiled while walking down the subway stairs. 
You are beautiful and I want us to get coffee and maybe play Pokémon Go together.
  
  
 Dollarama at Keele St., yesterday, Friday afternoon
 
We bumped to each other a couple of times in Dollarama, Friday afternoon. You looked at me intently with interest, and I did the same to you. You are a petite sexy dark haired woman with an accent. I had long hair, which was strewn all over my face, and I had a hairy face. I wore dark clothes and could have smelled sour, while you wore a grey dress (I think) and likely smelled good.
At the checkout line, I came behind you. The checkout clerk was pregnant. You bought a large yellow flower, and decided you did not want to buy something you had (a scented candle I think.) I looked at you squarely, and you looked at me. I was wild looking, and I noticed you were turned on by me. As I moved to take your place at the checkout, you lingered beside me fidgitting with your stuff.
I want to get to know, like, everything about you. Send me a message.

 Female 514 Streetcar Driver
 
You were the female streetcar driver on the new 514 cherry st route that runs along king st. You had long dark red/reddish brunette hair and was wearing aviator sunglasses. I just want to say I think you're smoking hot. If you're single, maybe we can grab a drink sometime?
  
  
 To my neighbour across the street whome I've been watching for a week
 
I've been doing something in the backyard for the last week or so, while looking towards you. We first spotted each other last summer in the same way, and throughout the rest of the summer I kept trying to dig you out of your house hoping to get closer to you, but I think you ended up avoiding me. I feel like we are deeply attracted to each other, but our circumstances make it difficult to be seen with each other.
You come out for a few minutes in the evening for me to watch you and you to watch me. If you are as attracted to me as much as I am to you and you are not involved with another guy, send me a message telling me what I have been doing the last week in the backyard. I promise to introduce you to new realms of pleasure, and make a permanent bond with you.
  
  
 Bulldog...what's going on?
 
What's going on?  It's been over a year.  Why haven't I heard from you before?  Stop playing now please, life isn't a game.  After you hear the news this week you know that for sure.
Did that old man give it up yet?  I really hope so...

 missed connections
 
At the airport and thinking of you.  What else is new?  
When do our paths finally collide and make this a reality?Sometimes I think we are on the same road just opposite sides and we didn't see eye to eye.  Or on the same sidewalk, bench, in the same room just different times of the day, week or month.  How strange life is?  Or that on the same road facing the same direction but this time I'm on my bike and you're parked and of course you're busy with your phone so there we missed each other again!  Yes, it's a never ending missed connections between us, will that be it for us?  A never ending missed connections!
  
  
 macs milk long shot
 
We had a quick chat about the woman ahead of us.   I found myself physically attracted to you.   Who were you with? If there's a mutual attraction would enjoy chatting, if your attached that's okay with me....
  
  
 Well dressed Short girl with glasses yonge subway
 
Crowded, am ride to work. I felt like you were going to lose balance from the way you were standing and surely enough you fell into me. I offered you a handle to grab on but you said you were ok. I didn't think it was anything special but you had a great smile when you said sorry.
We then got pushed back more to the back near the left side doors (left side facing going south). i saw you glance at me for a sec so now i wonder maybe if its possible to get to know you. I'm not sure if your single or anything so didn't push on to talk to you on a crowded subway morning.

  
  
 GOODLIFE - DUNDAS SAT MORN
 
In change room, you took a long time to change, wearing grey tight shorts.  Handsome man. 
We exchanged glances and then said hello and introduced ourselves. I had to leave.

 Blue Mountain Sauna!
 
We sat together in the sauna at Blue Mountain...One of you was born in Portugal...
You were two girls, visiting from Toronto.  You asked if I'd like to join you for 420 outside... It was a freezing change considering we were in a Sauna. I raised an eyebrow and said yes.
We walked to your car, and there was a hilarious moment when I sat in the back of your Audi and Asked you your names.  We remembered we had no idea!
After, when we were slightly stoned, I remember bumping into my family and in the akwardness of the moment I never got your contact!
Say something about me that you remember so I know its you!
Ciao

 PRIDE
 
I was wearing a white polo and beige shorts. Thought we had a connection.. Would love to get to know you/ get in touch!
Give me a shout if you remember me
  
  
 Why i won't be calling:
 
Let me preface this, by saying I only wish you well.I was upset for a long while, but more with myself, than with you.I'm responsible for the predicament I found myself in.You had your part , yes, but ultimately I could've done a great many things differently; then and since.
Lets straighten the record: The woman I met, my first trip up, was the one I fell for.Head over heels, I honestly loved her imperfections too.The woman I came up to live with, while different, was still amazing.You made me feel strong, powerful, like there was nothing that couldn't be achieved by us.Many things changed, we both made our share of mistakes. Niether of us were as real as we should've been.The woman that left home, choosing to go west, wasn't anything but a hologram if you will, of the one I fell for.
When you said to me, 'You'll pay ' , I knew, as I'm sure you do as well now, that just like the incident in Kenora, I said what I thought was best for 'US' , and if those records hadnt 'Disappeared' that would be very easy to illustrate.This is the only thing I want to say about our past, enough has been said by all.I'm putting this out there, for the gods and the univers, and for you should it find you.
That woman I fell so completely for, will always have a piece of my heart.That said, unless we literally bump into one another by chance, we shall prolly never speak again.While she has a place in my heart, there is and will never again be, a place in my life for her.We two, are too smart for our own good.Too intelligent, two insecure, and too willing to cause hurt to one another.Whether by words, or my mere presence, I will never again be willing to cause you pain, nor will I allow you to do likewise.I only want , that you find someone that makes you as happy as I once did.I want yoou to feell those butterfiles, and your whole face to light up again; I can still see your eyes shine in my minds eye.If I thought there was even a chance That I could bring that two you, I'd walk through hell and slay many demons for it; we both know that it'll never be though.
Be happy.Find the one that u shine.Put away  the insecurity, i hope you've learned as I have, how wasteful it is.Dont be afraid to live, and to be open. Ive learned to embrace even my short-cominfgs, not to hide them or from them.Your past is a badge of honour, only a wound if you let it be.For the record, it's why I stuck around so long, despite knowing what was happening.Silly things we rationalize, for love.Live and learn.Pleasxe find thatt happiness again, so I know your eyes wuill be shining, and you'll always be smiling.Let go of the negative energy, lest it consume you.Im not trying to minimize anything, on either of our sides, only suggesting that it's better to live for whats ahead, that whats behind.
You know whats what, and the prices paid already.More to come, I'm sure, for everyone. I've never run from my lessons, or my consequences. I've also never chased anyone, to ensure they meet theirs. That's one thing I'd like not to change; hopefully it wont have to.
I'll always remember you, just the way you were, I try not to think of the other you.I hope you'll try, at least, to do the same.Allow life to happen more, and have faith that everything will work out in i'ts own time.Stop trying to force it, or bend it to your will; in time, theres a price to be paid for such things.I know if you do let go, he will come.I wish you happiness, health and long life, and hopefully one day, I'll be lucky enough to find mine.Please don't attempt contact again, ever.No good can come of it.Perhaps we will meet again, in another life, if and when we are ready to.Til then, our roads go in different directions.Be well girl, I sincerely hope it , always and forever :)
XOXOXOXOXOXO

To the immature little girl who keeps letting the same person continually drive past them, all I can say is that I have irrefutably given up on you, and you certainly will be always remembered as to me; as an eternal like sort of class act loser...!

 Rooster Coffee
 
We were both with our respective co-workers, we shared a few glances. I was a little shy or else I would have tried to initiate some sort of conversation. You were wearing a pinkish shirt and had really nice eyes. If you have an idea who this is and are interested, I would like to meet you for coffee in the near future.
  
  
 subway dude with cat shirt
 
we were sitting across from each other on the subway, i was (am) drunk, you were wearing a weird shirt with cats on it. we made eye contact and you got off at royal york. let me know
  
  
 Scarborough town centre
 
You are a very beautiful, young black woman. You were standing outside the entrance to WalMart with a cart of groceries. 
I am the older gentleman that smiled at you when I came out of the store and again when I drove by when I was leaving. 
I should have offered you a ride. 
I do apologize. 
I'd like to hear from you. :)
  
  
 Finch and Victoria Park
 
We both got on the express bus going west at Finch and Victoria Park before noon. I got off at the seneca college stop. If you're reading this you know who it is and I would like to get to know you.
  
  
 Gym last night
 
You were at the gym last night with a few friends, I've seen you there before.  You're younger, fit, in the tank top.  What gym was it?
  
  
 We Gave It Our All
 
Time has gone by and we've moved on but we periodically  stop and think about the great times we had.  The dinners, the shopping, the parties and most importantly the sex we all shared.  It was truly the best of times.  Youve moved away and we could only hope you'd at least come visit if ever in Toronto.  Replacing you hasn't been easy especially considering our policy of complete discretion.  It's hard to trust someone like we did you.  We miss you!  Love T&M.
  
  
 Kmorin
 
We were supposed to meet up today downtown at your place, But I deleted your Email!!! Please if you see this I am not ignoring you, but rather can't get in touch with you! You lived near the CN tower and I think your email handle was Kmorin.
  
  
 GoodLife Richmond/John months ago
 
I worked out at the Richmond/John GoodLife a couple months ago. I'm a 30 year old white jacked up 6'2 245lb muscle guy. You were really muscular, looked like you could compete, shaved head, beard or scruff. Nodded to each other while lifting or in the change room, even outside the gym on the street. 
Hit me up if you remember me.
  
  
 King Streetcar (westbound) \"wanna sit?\"

You (white gal in pony tail with the most amazing eyes): No, thanks. I've been sitting all day.
Me: have a great weekend!
Want to grab a patio pint?? :)

We met in an airport security line and had a nice chat. Would love to go out for a coffee sometime, but never got your number... or name!
Longshot that you'll see this, but still a shot ;)
  
  
 Smoke's Poutine Y&E (girl with pink hair)
 
We were both in Smoke's today around noon. You sat at a table and I was on the \"bar top\" seating with a co-worker. You are super hot and I would have said hello if I wasn't with my co-worker. If you saw me and would like to go grab a drink or coffee, say hi! Let me know something about me so I know you aren't thinking about my co-worker instead :)
  
  
 Ttc younge to keele
 
We gotvom at the same time....exchanged stairs laong the way. You pulled your dress in a revealing way for me to see....or so it seemed.  
I was on my way to an event and memorizing some lines to say. Didnt get a chance to say hi! 
If you see this....tell me what I was wearing or the color of your dress so I know its you. 
Hope to hear from you!

 We worked together for a conference this week
 
You're from out of town but were here working a large conference downtown.  I was one of the local staff working with you.  
When I first saw you at the training I thought you were nice looking but didn't think much more past that.  However, The more I talked to you over the 5 days, the more attractive you became. You're a very driven guy and are teaching yourself programming and helping a friend get his business off the ground.  You like sports (surprise), but are too competitive to play just for fun as you wanna win \"all the ribbons\".  I could tell you are very smart and I found it so lovely that you were so open to talking about your learning disability.  Not sure you noticed but I made sure to slow down the occasional time I had to spell out a name to you so you could catch all the letters in the right order. 
Sadly I couldn't find a graceful way to ask you out since you were always with your co-workers in a group and I was surrounded by local staff at all times.  Also, I'm a fair bit older than you and that also kept me from thinking you'd be interested.  When you said goodbye yesterday you lingered for a minute and the way you looked at me made me think - maybe just maybe the feeling was mutual and you thought I was interesting too.  I had given you my cell number \"in case you needed something\" at the start of the conference - sadly you never used but I told you if ever you were in town to give me a call and we'd go for drinks - it's high unlikely that will happen but it was a last ditched attempt to let you know i was interested in chatting more.  I'm hoping that maybe, just maybe, you'll see this and reach out and say hey and we can continue this conversation via text.
If not I hope you have a great time at your sister's wedding .. I'm sure you'll be the prettiest maid of honour in all of Alaska this upcoming week.

  
  
 Brunette on subway at St Clair West
 
I got on at St Clair West at around 8pm yesterday, I sat in front of you. You're about 5'9, 5'10, brunette wearing a turquoise dress and sandals, with coral nail polish and art on your great toes. Pretty cute :-)
You had your headphones on and you got off at St Patrick. I think you caught me looking at you a few times, you had a happy face :-)
I'd like to continue this in front of a drink. Hopefully you'll drop me a line telling me how I looked like if you ever see this.

 Today
 
Didn't run into him today...
Feeling both disappointed but also relieved. There is just something about him that I still can't seem to forget. How I both wish to see and avoid him. Approach and resist. Fighting the contradictions, tangling with the bitter and sweet...

You got on a stop or two before Symington.

I gave you my number at Sheppard station and I know you told me you were going to be busy those days, but come to Montreal before the colds comes and I'll explore the city together with you.
  
  
 Re: it was great to see you yesterday
 
How weird? And what would it mean if I saw it? And how will you know if it's me?

 127 davenport bus
 
Hey, grey Herschel backpack. You smiled and waved \"hello\" to me when you were exiting the bus. I waved \"good-bye\" through the window as the bus took off. I've seen you many times, but always too shy to have a chat with you. I would like to get to know you, so if you see this send me a message.
  
  
 Mike at Yonge St Tattoos
 
You pierced my nipple today. You were really cute and pleasant to talk to. It's weird to be like \"so hey, here's my tit\" but you made it pretty non-awkward.

Crazy long shot....
You held the door for me leaving Bulk Barn in Etobicoke, lol

 my birthday - are you that special female?
 
So hope to meet that missed connection female this Sunday which happens to be my birthday.  You are mid 30s to mid 40s.  I can still turn heads.  Just want to go out have a couple drinks and might meet that special female.  Obviously I am not perfect and neither are others.  Have my rough edges and not claiming to be perfect but my heart is real.  Usually when I drop by The Only Cafe Bar I just keep to myself cause don't know anyone.  Physically I am mid 40s dark hair, brown eyes, decent shape, 189 lbs.  That is all you need to know for now.  Please don't reply with your picture - don't want it.  Don't ask for mine - like I said I can still turn heads!  Also don't reply with just - oh happy b day...... if you are serious in meeting then reply.
  
  
 Lisa are you out there?
 
Hi Lisa - we met briefly today.  I am sorry I didn't ask for your number !  dah !  
Anyway hoping you see this.  To confirm it's you tell me what I was wearing.
  
  
 We spoke about our hairdos Tuesday night at Bathurst Station...
 
I'm looking for the tall (superlatively tall like 6'4\") beautiful man I spoke with briefly on Tuesday night around 9:30 p.m. at Bathurst station. I was walking behind you. you hung back and waited for me to get on the escalator. you said you liked my hair. I said I liked yours too. you touched yours shyly and said thanks. you looked surprised that I had responded. but then, because I'm shy too around men I find to be exceptional, I continued texting whoever I had been texting. I feel so regretful about it now because where did you go? anyway I'm the short white girl with a really light blonde pixie cut, tattoos, booty shorts on and a black Jansport backpack. you're Black and have high hair and were wearing a short sleeve Oxford that would have been thoroughly heinous on most other humans. anyways, SUP SUBWAY CRUSH I'm not half as awkward as I seem and I think ur cute too. let's go for dive bar beers. 

  
  
 Fastest Subway Ride Ever
 
Met you on the subway today.  We talked about everything from books and bicycle helmets to crime statistics (unsurprisingly).  The trip from Eglinton to Finch has never been so quick.  I can't remember the last time I had such a natural conversation.  I know I should have asked you out as you exited Finch station one way and I went the other.  I would love to talk to you again over drinks (alcoholic or not) or dinner--I'm thinking Thai Food.
  
  
 Fairview mall
 
Wow....never fails... every time I go to fairview mall,  I never get disappointed. ..
Saw so many hot guys there the other day. 
I'm an attached white man,  in good shape and good looking. 
Hoping to find someone close to the mall or that goes there regularly. 
Please be white, of age and good looking /shape.

  
  
 For you C.
 
I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living, I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands, your crazy-kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't leave

  
  
 Middle Eastern Girl (Warden & Sheppard)
 
We live in the same building, im pretty sure you have a man but every time we cross paths i feel that you want to say something, i honestly feel the same way, i just dont know how to approach it because im not sure if you would brush me off or talk back, but i always get the feeling that you want to talk, really would love to get to know you, everytime i come home i wish to see you eventho we dont talk, i just love seeing you.
Most likely your not going to see this but who knows maybe this is the way to break the ice.

  
  
 Two guys in front of Imperial Pub
 
This is a really long shot, but around this time last year, as I was walking home late one night picking up some groceries, I stumbled upon two guys in front of Imperial Pub. One of you (I think you were black) stopped me saying you liked my jacket, and asked me if I wanted a drink with you and another guy, who had apparently just come from Dubai. It was all unexpected, and I was sweaty and carrying groceries lol so I declined, but it was interesting and it just stuck in my mind, and I kind of wish I had just went with it. Let me know if you're reading this by any chance. I was the Asian guy, black bomber jacket, wearing a baseball hat. I also had a septum ring on.
  
  
 To the beautiful Filipino girl on the bloor-danforth line going east
 
Hello,
You had dark hair, you look filipino (forgive me if im wrong ) , you had a dark bag and you were sitting with your chin resting ontop of your hand.
I was wearing a crimson hat with a green brim and a baseball tee that a gray/whiteish kind of middle and crimson sleeves as well as a black back pack. I'm tall, dark hair, glasses and kinda fit.
We kept exchanging glances, I find you very attractive.
If you're interested in talking, hit me up with an e-mail. :)
  
  
 Way way more complicated
 
Most nights I don't sleep because I miss you so terribly. 
The answer could be as easy as calling you or answering your many texts, I know. But what good would that do? We'd only end up doing exactly what we've always done, repeating the same patterns again and again. 
If you called and said those 3 little words, I'd be yours again. 
But the truth is, I wouldn't be. You don't make me happy anymore.
  
  
 Thank you!
 
Just wanted to thank some of the people on Missed Connections. Almost a year ago, I was in a dark place trying to process heartbreak from an abusive man. I wrote a post that cleansed my heart and my brain. My brain was finally able to stop going over and over what happened. 
I had many genuine replies from both men and women. All the encouragement, understanding and wishing me well was very comforting. 
I've been very happy ever since and I'd like to say those people helped me kick start that. 
So thank you.

Hey!
We were chatting not too long ago. You were going to have some free time. You work downtown, like me.
My app crashed and somehow you disappeared.
Hoping you see this. If you do, what app did we meet on?

  
  
 Guy jerking off at store front
 
I was walking home when I cam upon you jerking off at a store front close to Queen and Peter.
You are white, about 6'2\ seemed to have a few tattoos and was wearing sweatpants. You seemed a little startled when I walked by and tried to put your dick away. I smiled at you but unfortunately you didn't invite me over.
Would have loved to join!
  
  
 Girl wearing a light blue sundress at Starbucks Downtown - One Bedford
 
Hey,
You were the cuper cutesy girl at the Starbucks around the One Bedford St. building across from the St. George subway off Bloor St earlier this evening (Wednesday) around 8 PM or so. I think you left around 9 PM. 
Your hair was tied back and you were amazingly cute! :)
You were seated at one of the couches reading something and listening to your ear phones. 
If you happen to see this post, then I'd love to meet you for coffee again at that same location perhaps! ;-)
xoxoxo

  
  
 bank transaction
 
You helped me convert some foreign currency today. I thought you were really sweet and cute, and I couldn't tell if the vibes were mutual. If they are and you'd like to get a drink or something, let me know which currencies I sold you
  
  
 Tall Guy at Final Day of Fringe Toronto
 
Well, here goes.   Won't know unless I try.   
Final early evening at the Fringe Festival Toronto, Sunday, July 10th.   You were a tall gentleman, apparently waiting on a friend to arrive.  I believe you were enjoying a Steam Whistle in a can.  We had brief chat.   You asked if it was fine to stand where you were;  so as to not block my view of the performers across the way.   I said something to the effect that it was OK 'I'll just look at your butt'.  
It didn't put you off, and I'll be honest I was stuck where I was, but I'd peer out from time-to-time to see if you were nearby.  I wanted to have a chat, but it was difficult.  You did come back a couple of times, always pleasant and friendly.   I could be wrong about all of this, but if I didn't try how would I know?   This is a long shot!
You were;  I am guessing, about 6'2\" or better, with short hair, wearing a button up shirt and shorts.   I think sandals maybe.  
Oh well ... if you do happen to see this, and you recall who I am (I think it's easy to figure out), then contact me.   Thanks!!!   Your friend did arrive, but I had no idea if this is just a friend or your partner.  ;)   I'd like to buy you a Steam Whistle IF we make a connection.

 Hamilton 2:30 PM GO bus to Toronto. 13 July
 
As soon as I walked on the bus I was intrigued by your presence, and by your strikingly beautiful appearance. I made a comment about a lucky penny, the one you had dropped? :-)

you were putting on sunscreen or lotion as i walked into the change room. You had a mustache and black shorts on.  Saw you looking as i got undressed and as i went into the shower area to take a cold shower before my workout. You are so handsome and i'm very interested. 
If you see this, get back to me if you're interested. 
This was around 12:30 this afternoon

 Asian lady at Canadian Tire gas bar Sheppard and Mccowan
 
I was standing by my car and you asked for help pumping gas around 8:30pm last night. You were slender with some amazing pussy lips that were bulging in your tight pants. I really wanted to comment on them and ask if you wanted some relief. I would welcome the opportunity to pleasure them.
  
  
 Journey Concert Molson amphitheatre
 
I was working the show when you started talking to me about soccer. We had a pretty long conversation about the Euro Cup. You were at the show with your husband and left to get a drink. 
I wanted to tell you how stunning and gorgeous you were but I hesitated. 
You were wearing a black tight lululemon shirt and had gorgeous eyes. 
This is a long short but worth a try.
  
  
 re: asian guy riding subway with his gf
 
No he would not do better if he was with you, since when a slut has been better than a real woman?

 Danforth 113 Bus from Main St
 
I'm hoping you see this..
You were just on the 113 bus and got off at Dawes Road, you sat beside me in the 2 seater directly across from the back doors. Our connection began when you sneezed and I said bless you (I sort of whispered it actually..) and we looked at each other when you said thank you ;)
You then said good night as you were leaving, and as you crossed at Dawes and the bus pulled off we were both looking for each other to wave bye :)
I'm hoping you find me :)
  
  
 Tallest man on earth concert
 
This may be a long shot but...
I saw you dancing at the tallest man on earth concert at the danforth music hall on monday july 11th. You were with some friends, a couple I believe. You were dancing and kept playing with your hair. I wanted to say that you are beautiful. You had a few beers and appeared to be a bit drunk so I didn't approach, though I wish I did. Your dancing made me happy. Stay free and keep dancing, beautiful girl.
  
  
 recurring eye contact outside of coffee shop at kensington
 
Hey, you were sitting with a girl who looked about your age this afternoon outside of Moonbean Coffee, I was with a group of friends, but kept glancing over and noticed you were too. Anyways, hello~ 
Let me know if you'd like to say hi~ what was I wearing?
  
  
 I told you the light in the men's wasn't working
 
Then you came down, and turned it on for me.  I said \"oh\"
You then went back up the stairs, and I called out for you saying your ass is showing through your shorts. You fixed it, and said thanks and went back.
If you want to do stuff, tell me if you recognize me.

 checking you out on the YUS line ;)
 
have you ever felt like you were being stared at (by a guy)? particularly on the yonge-university-spadina line. has it happened, maybe even once by a specific person you would be interested in - but you weren't sure why he was staring cause he had an intimidating stern look in his face? i have the \"man version\" of resting bitch face and when i stare - it's actually cause i think you're really hot ;) i'm a masculine mid-late 20s-looking bearded guy and if this situation seems familiar, hit me up with what i look like and what i was wearing/doing
  
  
 star wars headphones- doc martens
 
We were walking along Yonge st and you told me you liked my tattoos. I should have said more to you but I didn't. Find this, and tell me what we had in common.
  
  
 Subway stranger, June 23rd
 
We both got on at Finch station in the morning, going southbound. Before you got off at St. Andrew, you doubled back to pay me a compliment. I wanted to ask you out but you caught me off guard. Reply with what a description of what I look like if you want to grab a drink sometime.

 Flowers in the front, lettuce in the back
 
You: I first noticed the flowers but what really got me going was the lettuce sticking out of your backpack. The fact you were also biking just sealed the deal. You looked great in that burgundy shirt. I hope you enjoy tonight's salata. 
Me: on the loveless patio enjoying two bottles of Chardonnay in the dwindling sunlight. Handsome dark bearded olive complexion man with wandering eyes. ;)

 Looking for a Joe
 
Looking for a \"Joe Sampson\" I met November 2014 at Omni King Hotel. Pretty sure it was a fake name, but you fucked me good and I would like to see you again. I was the Asian guy wearing a snapback and all black. You asked me for a massage, and you fucked me after making out and me sucking you off. You had all the lights off, and it was hard to make out what you looked like, but you reminded me of David Thewlis and Ken Marino lol. Let me know if this is you.
  
  
 Man in a dark blue suit
 
I have never posted on this site before, but nothing really fit what I was trying to do quite like this ad. I'm not really sure if you could call it a missed connection, more like a missed possible connection I suppose. We were on the 504 Broadview. You got off at Broadview Ave. You removed your jacket when you got on the streetcar, bespectacled, 30s, flicks of grey hair and chewing a gum :) On the -0.00001% chances you see this and are actually interested, let's go for coffee sometime.
  
  
 St. George to Islington - 7 AM (Red Top, Long Skirt)
 
You were travelling from St. George to Islington on 12th July around 7 AM. We were in the same train on the University line too. You wore the most beautiful red top with a long flowing skirt. You were so beautiful, calm, serene, the pure aura. We were sitting opposite to each other.
We kept stealing glances.
We got off and I went to the Tim Hortons and you stood behind me. I wanted to turn and say Hi and ask you for coffee but I missed the opportunity.
You took your snack and walked out the door.
I feel you work just close by. I would like to have coffee with you sometime and talk to you.
  
  
 Blonde with nose ring s/b on Yonge line

 Dear Leah...
 
Why are you ashamed of me? And why haven't you acknowledged myself yet? From the guy that always wanted to hold your hand, but for some uncomplicated reason you were always holding onto someone else's
Ps... why does everyone have a fit when they see a post for a certain Leah on here? Is she really that to important everyone? Or just to herself? Also by the way, Leah, I'd give you a bus ticket to come over here with, but the last time I picked up your bus ticket for you, I think you most certainly did chagrin at my rear! You suck!
Whats my name...?

Absolutely gorgeous. Would love to have a coffee with you
  
  
 I miss you and crave you so much.
 
I've been trying so hard to stay away from you and not think about you, but it's nearly impossible.  I need to realize that you're no good for me and I should move on to something better, but I can't.   I can't stop thinking about your round curves and how tiny you feel in my hands.  I can still smell you when I think about you.  I dream about pulling you to my lips and  looking at you while I lick your holes.  You're so sweet and I can't fight of this craving anymore. I need you!  I love you donut! I'm on my way to Tim Hortons to eat you right now!

 This Past Saturday - Girl in Vortex line from Canada's wonderland
 
This past Saturday, july 9, we were making lots of eye contact in vortex line where I first saw you and around the park. You were with your friend in the \"fast pass\" line and I was with my frind in the normal line. I really wanted to talk to you but I couldn't find you after you went onto psyclone around the last hour of the park being open. You had curly hair, light skin tone, around 5'8\"-5'10\" and really cute. 
I'm hoping you find this and reply back.

 The Dream
 
A whisper in the night,
Or just a bad dream,
I have been shown the way,
Failure to act causes the pain,
I don't know why,
I have never heard the calling,
Until now,
I don't believe,
Never have,
An atheist to the bone,
The people's God Whispers to me,
Teach them now,
So they may survive,
To help those who are left behind.
From: the book of dreams.

  
  
 Driving north on Keele
 
Hey, I doubt you'll see this, but thought I'd give it a shot.
This afternoon I exited 401 to go North on Keele...you may have done the same as I saw you beside me just a little bit after that.
I couldn't help but notice that you were looking at me...and your tongue practically out of your mouth!  I then looked down and realized why.
Get back to me with what I was driving if you want more!
  
  
 You are moving to vancouver to do your masters
 
You and I sat beside each other on our computers a few weeks ago and I offered you some website suggestions for apartment rentals to help you with your upcoming move to BC. It was a pretty brief meeting. 
I think it would be a good bad idea to see each other again before you go. Hope you do too.

  
  
 Cactus Club number by memory
 
So I shockingly forgot your number, but I do remember your name. Can you tell me anything about where we were located in the bar or what we were doing there? So I know it's you
Hope you do cause I really liked chatting with you and would be interested to explore those conversations a little further.

 Didn't we see each other last week?
 
I didn't see you today, when I was walking home from work.  You won't see me tomorrow.  I thought I would post on here and hope you see this.  We are always texting so we don't see fuck all.  The odd time I do see you, or, someone, I don't say hello. I just keep going and then post on missed connections.  If I did say hello, I wouldn't have a fantasy to post here...and hope would be lost.  If you want a blow job some time, let me know what colour your shirt was.

 looking to reconnect
 
I'm an Irish guy who used to live in Toronto for 3 years. I left over a year ago. One night I was walking home from the village towards Weseley station and I caught eyes with the beautiful brazillian man. We both turned around and did a double take and started talking. We went for a beer across the road and there was a serious connection.  He brought me back to the condo he was house sitting for his friends and we had some beers and smoked some doob. We did alot of kissing but it was all very innocent. We woke up the next morning and he was really sweet and made me breakfast  but told me he was hiv positive but undetectable. I kinda freaked out and went very quiet. I was a bit weird with him from then on but shouldnt have been so ignirant.I only remember his name as Evan which was short for a Brazilian name and he worked for a bank downtown. If you ever see this please get in touch. You really were a sweetheart
  
  
 Black and White Dress in Bloordale Village
 
You were wearing a black and white dress and walking to work, I presume. And you were singing to Janet Jackson's Escapade and I knew in that moment I wanted to have escapes with you.
You were also walking with a slight limp. Is your foot ok?

 Old School brunch
 
Have gone to Old School for brunch a couple of times during the past month (including Sunday) and you were working behind the bar both times.  I thought you were really cute and nice (although I realize it is your job to be nice) and would love to grab a drink sometime if you are single/interested.
If you see this (which I'm sure is unlikely) send me an email and let's chat.

 52 Lawrence Bus Eastbound
 
To the beautiful  young Asian woman ( I assume you're Filipina?) sitting all the way at the back of the 52 Lawrence Bus headed to Lawrence east station this morning, I just wanted to say that you were looking absolutely fine and beautiful. 
It was around 7am this morning (Monday, July 11) and I got on at Keele and Lawrence. I was the Filipino guy who sat accross you, reading a metro newspaper. I had an American Eagle brand shirt on with blue jeans and brown shoes.
I wanted to ask for your number as we got off at Lawrence east station, but was too shy to do so. Anyway, if you're reading this, I hope you respond. I would like to take you out for a coffee some time.
  
  
 WHEN THE SHTF.
 
A miss connection, 
Thay have lost the way amoung human kind,
Money is all they want,
After the money comes your soul,
No one can blame you,
 For being so weak,
After all what can money not buy you,
The best clothes,
The best cars,
The best companion and wine,
Our world is a melting pot of sins,
Without the guilt or remorse, 
Since we can not fail, 
After all, we are God's chosen few,
Even if those chosen few have some rotten apples, 
The higher power speaks through many means,
But the message is seldom seen.
Armageddon is well on its way,
Was the message from above, 
Save my children was all it said,
Teach the people to survive,
To help those who are left behind.
From the book of dreams.

  
  
 Hot guy outside marriott earing center
 
You were wearing light gray jeans and dark top, light beard on chin, your right foot has bandage. I was smoking cigarettes and having coffee and you were sitting across me with your stainless steel coffee mug.
You were looking sideways but never at me probably avoiding eye contact.
What caught my attention was your crotch, you have meat in your thighs man and your crotch was hottest thing in those fitting jeans, what a sight to start mon morning :-)
This was around 6:30am.
I wish I could admire those spread thighs, crotch, taint and I bet you got a hot ass dude.
I wish I could bury my face between those meaty thighs.

 R. from the Melody Gardot concert
 
Hi R.,
You sat behind us at the Melody Gardot concert and we discussed our common background.  I felt we said good-bye too abruptly and I wish I had had the opportunity to say thank you for your advice re. my computer problems.  If you see this, please get in touch.  It would be nice to have a friend to talk to re. our common background and to listen to my laptop blues : ).
If you answer this, please let me know what our common background is and the advice you gave me.
Thanks

 Medicine
 
You used to give us the medicine but I guess you don't work there anymore, you're Asian, sometimes had a pony tail, we exchanged looks whenever I was there.
What happened to you? Where are you?
  
  
 I moved over a store
 
I don't know your story, but I know it's the worst kind of pain
All of these questions about you linger. Clearly my subconscious is trying to sort through it all.
Because I keep dreaming of you,
Last night you were sick and in the hospital and I was trying to find you to help you
Is it truly that brutal and cruel, that you just wanted to hurt me. 
I really trusted you and believed that you wanted to help

  
  
 RE: I miss you
 
Excuse me, but instead of writing \"missed connection\" posts, maybe you would do better for yourself by focusing on the problems you CAN do something about.  If you're with someone who doesn't give a shit about your young child, and you are in full knowledge of this fact, based on what you've written, you're a shitty fucking selfish parent.  Get your shit together and stop writing bullshit on anonymous websites.  Your son will forgive you, but you'll never forgive yourself no matter how selfish of a person you are.  That's your own flesh and blood.  Shame on you.  It's shitty parents like you who don't realize how much shit like this affects a kid when he/she grows up into an adult.  Fuck you.
  
  
 Good Looking Guy at Steamworks
 
We had fun today and I really enjoyed being with you. You live in North York and I live in the same place as your parents.  Anyway, message me if you'll like to get to know me better.
  
  
 Sunday night at the ol' steam room
 
Sunday evening in the steam room at the Good Life at Richmond and John. You were adorable but I didn't think too much of it until you stood up and used the in-room shower, making it clear you had intentions beyond a good steam. When you came back and sat down next to me, you said \"that does a world of good,\" which just struck me as so sincere and a nice change of pace from the typical gay douchebaggery I encounter from people cruising me in that steam room. Anyways, we had like 45 minutes of silent flirting and I had fully intended on giving you my number when we both walked out of the gym at the same time, but it didn't quite work out. You were wearing a backwards hat and a maroon shirt when you got dressed, but that's all I got.

 Digital dreams after party day 2
 
Hi this is a long shot but I saw you at the club and you asked me to take a picture of you but your phone ran out of storage. You then took a picture of my brother and I. I was rolling hard and forgot to ask you for your name lol. I know you were with someone else but if he was not your boyfriend I'd love to talk. If not we can still be rave friends right?
P.s. I'm korean and was wearing a black long tee
  
  
 Donovan at Keele and Finch
 
You offered me a ride at 5 am but I didn't go for it. So you parked your car and came to talk to me and you were a breath of fresh air. Did you memorize my number? I wanna talk to you again :)
  
  
 Guy with long blond hair at Mc donalds (9th July)
 
You were sitting with a friend and had a white shirt on.
We saw eachother a couple of times,  I really wanted to talk to you but felt super shy
If you remember me tell me what was I wearing
  
  
 miss you
 
I miss you. Fucking call me.
I miss you.  Fucking call me.
I miss you. Fucking call me.
  
  
 Got off at Queen stn together
 
I've never posted one of these and feel completely ridiculous but...
You had long brown hair and a beard and amazing hazel eyes, a tattoo on your left forearm. 
You stared a couple times and then we made eyes and I was my awkward self about it. You probably just thought my outfit was weird anyway.
I was wearing an obnoxious outfit (it was festival day at work) - striped black and white pants, blue vans. 
But if you are interested in grabbing a coffee or a drink :) -can tell me anything about my top or what was on my head? 
Xx

  
  
 Saw you at crews on sat night
 
You were by yourself dancing and drinking water everytime. We shook hands and I commented on you.
Let me know what that comment was on? If you are the same guy
I would like to know you more and take you out for coffee. 

  
  
 Urban Outfitters June 11th
 
To the handsome man who was wearing a teal obey hat that asked me \"what's on sale?\" on June 11th ,I'm so sorry I walked away without asking your name,  I'm a bit shy and apparently such a fool.. If you get this msg, would love to grab a coffee with you.  Please say yes! :) tell me what you were wearing so I could know it's you.
  
  
 Beaufitul dark-haired girl - The Rex patio - Saturday 9th July evening
 
Hi,
on Friday evening, after 8PM, You and your girlfriend were sitting on small table in The Rex patio situated along St Patrick St. I was seating nearby, on a big table with a group of friends. You and me were sitting facing each other. You were in a very nice two-colors dress and your friend was in dark blue dress.
I couldn't help glancing at You every few minutes. I noticed You doing the same. Wanted to come to your table and say \"Hello\ but was afraid of my linguistic incompetence as English is not my first language:) Girl, you looked stunning!
Would be great to see you again.
  
  
 Hey L
 
Hey, remember when you and I were the class acts together and we dressed up as cowboys, and transsexuals even, ha! and then you humiliated me, and were even ashamed of me before and ever since. Well I'm loser, good times eh!  Wish I had a hand to hold on to but you gave it someone else, or a pair of arms to hug but again you filled them with someone elses, or a nice glowing smile to return to someones bosom but you let someone else stand in the mirror - but nevertheless I don`t have any of those things to give to anyone nowadays because to you L, for some god awful shameful reason why, I will forever be the loser alone in the mirror with the mashed potatoes! Why... No first kiss, or hug, or walking down the aisle, or even a nice trip to the cottage together, no... just whole lot of sadness and what could never be`s!
  
  
 Warehouse Blondie (you left and wanted to come w. me!)
 
You left with your \"friend\" who was very short, but you wanted to come with me.  Come hang out now.  
You: Tall, Blonde, super fun and you and I utterly attracted to eachother.
We need to hang out today.

 Massage at Spa Excess - July 8 TNT
 
I lay on the bench in the dark room while you massaged my stress away.  You were a smooth tall white guy who gave a massage better than an RMT.  I would surrender my body to you anytime.  It felt so great.  I just wish my whole body was massaged. I'd love to meet you again.  This time I'll bring massage oil with me so you get an easier rubdown.
  
  
 Y central lockers
 
walked in today saw u staring at me above the lockers I stared back. You have dark hair 30-40 great body and wera in underwear watching me . get in touch if you see this
  
  
 Mary who works at starbucks -- Leslie & Lakeshore
 
Hey Mary. This happened about 1030pm tonight (saturday). 
Unsure if it was customer service at its finest - aka - you just doing your job. Either way.
You noticed I was feeling a bit down, and asked me if it was work related or life. You have no idea how you brightened up my night. I came back about 15 minutes after, and asked your coworker (who usually doesn't work there at that location, but is helping out) if you're in the back area  - he said you had left already. I'm kicking myself right now for not biting at the opportunity while you were in front of me. 
I was the Asian guy with thick black glasses. 
Lets go for a coffee and walk? 
... and if any of you who work or visit starbucks at leslie and lakeshore see this, relay the message to her - by showing this ...
  
  
 The TSA guy who likes video games and is actually friendly at 9:30am!
 
I am an idiot for not catching his name. I usually am brilliant about such details, haha. Oh well. I suppose airports will do that to a person. Hopefully someone reading this can figure it out!
Young guy, slender, mid-to-late 20s perhaps, with short curly black hair. He was working on the security line for flights to the U.S. on Saturday, 9 July. We talked for a few minutes and I showed him an NES cartridge that my friend had given me.
I liked talking to him. :) After I finally extricated myself from the gnarly mess that is Me Trying To Fly Internationally (we talked about that, too), I kicked myself for not...um....something. I didn't know what, exactly. But I do know that I'd like to talk to him again sometime in my life. I also found myself thinking that he would probably really enjoy all the retro game-stuff that my friend is involved with in that area. Also, she could probably hook him up with an NES. ;)
If you know him (or *are* him, against all odds), please drop me a line!
  
  
 Spacebound Eminem for Jordan :)
 
For j.s
It's been about nine months now, and I still feel the same. I miss you so much, and still want you. I've come to realize there will never be anyone or anything close to, what I had with you. The honesty and pure comfort level we had. It's all I wanted and still want to this day. Was able to be me no judgements. You made me feel amazing. 
Part of me still hopes/believes you'll reappear. Happened before. As more time passes, against all reason I still hope for that. Would answer and let you in again. 3am or 4am or anytime, any day. Didn't lie when I said I missed you, meant it more than you know
My other part wonders if any of it was real. Did I do something wrong?  Want could I have done different?  Why didn't you respond to my messages
I tried my best to show you how much I cared. That will never change. No matter what happened between us. Would go through hell with you. Always be there and work through it with you. I want it all. Was and am all in. 
I'm not even sure you'll read this.  I'm sending it out to the universe anyways. Single and home. Waiting on something that may never come back. Hoping against hope. 
I mean the rough sex was amazing. The tender kind, was out of this world. You taught me how to make love. The difference between the two. Mixing the two. 
First time I really cared for someone, and only time was you. I thought I did before, was so wrong. 
The sex alone was and still is the best sex of my life, and was always satisfied
You may have had nothing to offer but you. I only have me too. Was and is enough. Never been the type to need more. 
Anyways this song really touched home for me. Explained me with you. Lyrics hit me. All I could think of was how I felt about you
Disclaimer *minus the violent parts and crazy shit. Not those parts*
I will go on living etc and wish no harm on you. Only happiness. Even if not with me

  
  
 Nofrills grocery at Parliament & Gerrard
 
Hi, we were shopping tonight around 6pm, you were wearing a black/gold dress,
and we kind of near bumped into each other a few times.  You are pretty and sexy haha,
but I was shy to start a conversation :-)
If you are the one, tell me how we checked out at the lineup. 
Coffee sometime?

  
  
 Vincent at FIGO
 
You served me on Thursday, July 7th. I thought there was a spark. 
I promised to come back and leave you something. Did you get it?
  
  
 You are dearly missed

 Guy walking on Dupont and dufferin
 
I was waiting for the bus with a pack of doorknobs. You had mid length hair. Scruff. Shorter guy with cream cargos a black Tshirt backpack and carrying a cart. You were cute.  We made eye contact. Then I noticed your big cock. Then you noticed me noticing it. Haha. It was a moment.  Hit me up if you wanna grab a beer sometime. 

  
  
 Sherway Food Court, grey Jays hat 3:30
 
You sat down in the food court at around 3:20. You were wearing a black t, grey shorts with a grey blue jays hat. You were texting most of the time. You had a bit of a scruffy look, athletic build too. Couldn't stop looking at that bod of yours. 
I'd love to give you a nice blowjob and try it out with you. Even if your not bi or gay, love to try it.
What colour were your shoes
  
  
 I had enough of this break-up
 
Instead of wallowing in sadness after our break-up I decided to date others almost immediately. I have met numerous men and have experienced many (mis)adventures. In the back of my mind I wish I could have spent my time with you. But you chose not to be with me. Did you let me go so that I may realize that you're the one I want to be with? If you did, this was unnecessary because I already knew you're the one for me even before we had broken up. 
Do you even miss me?

 A with the e-cig (Pride saturday night)
 
I met you on Church St, last Saturday night, while taking to some people outside. We hung out for a few hours, walking on the street, chatting with different people, along with another friend you made at the bar that night. You ended up going to cz, but I was too tired by then! Wish I had gotten your number to hang out in the future. You seemed like a great guy and I feel like we might have a lot in common.
If you need a hint, our names both start with A, I'm a few years younger than you and you let me try your e-cigarette (which tasted amazing, by the way). Send me a message if any of this rings a bell.

 Cute Asian girl wearing a black dress at the Eaton Centre - Friday.
 
Hey,
You were the cutie who was at McDonalds and then went to the Apple Store until closing where I saw you again! LOL
You were super cute! :) 
Write back if you see this!
xoxo

  
  
 I still think you're a liar
 
And full of crap.
Thanks for throwing me under the bus.
You are some kinda vindictive eh
Remember back when you told me you thought people were talking badly about you behind your back?  They were.
They said you loved playing the victim...that you were good at it.
Wow, were they ever right.
I feel used.  Did you get the attention you were looking for?
I really dodged a bullet.  Whew !!
  
  
 You gave me a smoke at Kipling Stn
 
At first i just saw you smoking.  
Once i made eye contact you left me kinda speechless.  You were gorgeous.
Would you like to hang out?

 McDonald's upsidedown
 
I couldn't take my eyes off of yours, I felt kinda locked in, you we're on the side waiting for your order, and I came up to you and asked if this place was always this crazy. You have beautiful eyes and a gorgeous smile, and I'd like to meet you for coffee...
  
  
 On a bus full of kids ...
 
... you were doing a difficult job with patience and charm.
(And yes, your top did match your eyes.)
You looked like you could use a stiff drink -- let's get one sometime.
  
  
 Very Tall David at Pegasus
 
David- I met you last Sunday night (July 3) at Pegasus- I'm the Asian guy from Washington, DC, visiting for pride weekend- you are absolutely gorgeous and kind and I can't stop thinking about what you said to me- chances are nothing will come out of this since we're in different countries, but I figured getting to know a new friend would be cool- everyone I (and my friends) met while visiting Toronto have been so nice, and you particularly stuck out with your youthful enthusiasm! I really hope you find this!
  
  
 Saw you in line at Buddies on Pride Saturday
 
My friends and I were in line since 9:30pm on Pride Saturday at Buddies. 
You had chin-length blonde hair, wearing a red/pink silk (tank) top and dark jeans, bright lipstick...you're gorgeous.
You were surrounded by friends in line. 
My group was right behind you until people kept jumping in front of us.
I wanted to say 'hi', but couldn't...really regretting it now. 
If you (or any of your friends) are reading this, I'd love to connect with you. 
I was wearing a straw fedora that night and smiled at you a few times.
  
  
 post an ad for Me
 
When we last met you were ever so quiet, 
barely speaking 4 lines of text;
Your black typed demeanor, juxtaposed against virginal white background.
and I wonder ... 
yes, it is all anonymous ... but do you share?
What truths, desires, and thoughts turn your head ... 
and I wonder ... 
there was so little in those 4 lines and so much to learn.
.... post an ad for Me

  
  
 The Cold Within...
 
Paralyzed by this,
relentless freezing rain
in my heart,
this unyielding debilitating blizzard of pain
in every part. . .
I wish you were not so
indelibly etched in my mind,
Wish you were readily erasable,
so I could easily wipe you off,
scrub this darkness off my imprisoned, tortured mind,
let a sliver of light in. . .
just be able to breathe,
just for a little while,
please. . .

  
  
 \"volpsy\" you left me a message
 
volpsy\ I got your message under my door.
I wasn't home. Please respond when you can.

 Asian who followed me out of subway at noon on June 28
 
I looked at you from afar on the subway. At one point you raised your eyebrows. I thought it was my imagination.   I got out and noticed that you did too.  
You were delayed getting out of the station behind a woman with a stroller.   You lost sight of me but when I looked side ways you were going outside and it appeared you were looking for someone. I took my chances and followed you to the corner and you seemed to give up. You turned to go north on Yonge. I passed you hoping you would catch up and I would invite you to join me for lunch at Lee Chen. But you turned on Asquith.   By the time I got to my senses and decided to approach you you had given up. I followed you but could not catch up. It looked like you might go in where the food court was so I went into the Bay hoping to run into you but it was not meant to be.   I then went to have  a warm drink at Starbucks thinking of what might have been... but also getting my excitement to subside before returning to the office.
Sounds familiar? Send me a note with some description. We can take it from there.
  
  
 I'm too old for you
 
Whenever I come into your shop you're there and greet me with a smile and remember the last time I was in there.  Unfortunately, I think I'm way to old for you.  So I'll just keep coming in and buying stuff so I can see you.
  
  
 tinder connection
 
We were just talking about our 420 ways. When I got kicked off Tinder. Patrick was your name. Thought I'd post on here to see what will happen.
  
  
 SJ- I miss you my Soca Queen
 
I really hate how we ended our friendship. I truly believe we are meant for each other and we made bad choices by picking others when we clearly are fantastic together.  Even you don't want anything romantic I'll be more than happy to get my dance partner back. I want to dance with you again at a soca fet!

 Hot blond man in the showers!!!
 
You came into the showers while my boy and I were showering and you were watching the both of us clean our selves off. You were getting off watching us shower with your raging hard on and we both wanted to have fun with you and it seemed you wanted it too. If this is you, please reply, because both of us would love to have some fun with a sexy man as in yourself. Tell me what kind of shorts you were wearing or what time you caught the ferry going back into the city.
  
  
 bright red hair- Adelaide & uni
 
We've run in to each other before and spoken about being alternative. Youre cute with neon red hair. You smiled at me as we passed on the street this morning. Maybe you'll see this and we could grab a drink?
  
  
 GO Train Umbrella
 
We were both on the 8:27am Oakville - Union GO train Friday morning July 8th.  We were both in jeans.
As we stood at the light at Bay and Front I asked you if we were going to need that umbrella later today.  You said \"I hope not but you never know\".
I wanted to tell you how beautiful you were but chickened out.  You are a naturally beautiful woman and I wanted to let you know that.
  
  
 What more do you want from me I'll give it you
 
If it's my heart its been yours along. That's why I can hear you right now. I now you want me too. 
I'd run to you right now. 
My boss will understand. This job doesn't own me. No one does. I want to be with you mike I'll wear a rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used to please say yes

 I am in love with Mike Robichaud and I want to spend the rest of my li
 
fe with him. *drops mike* Dude can we please just stop with the fucking clowning around and get together???? We are meant for another. I must have watched atleast 800 movies last year and I could not find a love like ours in any of them. I love you and I deserve to be happy and I deserve a guy like you. i want to be with you so bad but I don't want to hurt people anymore. I mean I live with a guy now but I don't feel for him the way I feel for you and he doesn't love me like you do. He would never write such beautiful things for me. He never really tried to understand me until I threatened to break up with him. I'm just scared to be with him now because he's really jealous and I'm scared of how he will react :(((( He's a very sweet guy but he just doesn't undesrtand what we have. 
I need you Mike. If you're truly wild at heart then you'll fight for your dreams. Please please please please please please save me i don;t want to be in a prison of guilt anymore. I'm peach stuck in bowser's castle and I suck at video games :( 
I want to make a movie with a happy ending. Enough with the italians and their depressing shit and the french and their self loathing. I made a movie about bravery because our generation doesnt have one. Please please please please please help me. i need you to be brave for me. I know you are. I know you died for me too.
  
  
 Dial A Cliche
 
Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
Do as I do and scrap your fey ways\"
(dial-a-cliche)
grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!\"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go
does he slide by the wayside
or...does he just die
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
Do as I do and scrap your fey ways\"
(dial-a-cliche)
grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!\"
(dial-a-cliche)
the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!\"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!

The train stopped at Budapest. We had a four train ride ahead and I thought you were really hot so I wanted to sit next to you. To my surprise, you ended up being one the most charming men I've ever met in my entire life. You had such a beautiful way with words and everything you said you made me laugh. You had dreams. You said that you worked as a lawyer and that you were about to become one of the youngest junior partners at your firm. You were on a vacation. You were trainhopping around Easter Europe with your friend Cary. He hated me since day one because you weren't paying any attention to him because of me. I get why he was mad, I would be pissed too if my best friend was ignoring me but you we were just so into each other that nothing else mattered. 
Anyway, your dream was to become a pilot but the lessons were apparently way too expensive. Your parents offered to pay for them (even if the meant that they had to take out a second mortgage on their house) but you refused, you wanted to wait until you had enough money saved up so that you could pay for the lessons yourself. You said that they would mean so much more to you that way. You truly realize the value of something once you worked very hard for it. And you know how to work hard. Look how far you've come, Mr. Fancy pants studying at the best law program in the country AND doing a masters on top of that. You set very high goals for your self. I always admired that about you. 
Anyway, once the train stopped you and I were relunctant to part ways. We took the same metro car together and you paid for my ticket because I didn't have any forints. The ticket was 300 forints and I freaked out. I said no no no no no no no that's too much. You looked at me and said: calm down, it's only a dollar or something. I did and we went to the car together, riding to who knows where. I didn;t even bother to check where my hostel was. I had no idea where I was going, I was that enchanted by you. 
We said good bye at the train station. I thanked you for the metro ticket and you wished me luck on getting back to my hostel. We added each other on facebook, even though we would probably never speak again and then we parted ways. Of course I got lost. The streets were dark and Hungarian is a totally messed up language. It sounds nothing like other slavic languages so I couldn't really ask for directions. I found my hostel two hours later, sweaty, gross and exhausted but I was so glad to be there. The hostel was so clean and smelled really nice. I slept like a baby that night. I also slept easy knowing that you were in the same city. Even though we were not in the same room, I felt that I was with you that night. 
Anyway, I wandered aimlessly around the city. I got lost a multiple times and deep down I was thinking would it be awesome if I bumped into Mike right now? Anyway I found myself near the parliament by the river bank and I looked at the river. Then a little breeze brushed my face and something made me turn my head to the left. I saw you standing there in the distance, further down the river bank. Our eyes locked and I everything stopped, everything. I saw nothing but you and I've never felt happier in my entire life. We spent the rest of the day together. We toured the Parliament, watch Brazil get destroyed during the world cup and then we destroyed a bathroom at that nice hostel. I felt so bad the next morning . We nearly broke off the sink. We didn't make love though. I didn't think that I would deserve someone as beautiful as you and I told you. You walked away without saying anything and we never saw each other again. But hey, life is not a movie and our movie isn't over yet :) 
P.s. I thought of the robins when I heard your bell. 
I am a poor freezingly cold soul
So far from where I intended to go
Scavenging through life's very constant lows
So far from where I'm determined to go
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love
But you see, I've got no charm
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold
Oh, this is very clear to you
And you can tell I have never really loved
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no one gave me anything
No one has ever given me anything
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye
You must be such a fool to pass me by
  
  
 mysterious girl
 
deja vu, getting tim horton's, absent-minded, shy . . .
I'm fascinated; I'd like to get to know you. Hopefully someday . . .
  
  
 I died last night but then i heard the bell.
 
I used to walk with you
Along the avenue
Our hearts were carefree and gay
How could I know I'd lose you
Somewhere along the way?
The friends we used to know
Would always smile \"Hello\"
No love like our love they'd say
Then love slipped through our fingers
Somewhere along the way
I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me
So now I look for you
Along the avenue
And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way
(Nat King Cole song. You're  with me every time I listen to it. Our whole lives are ahead of us. Isnt that exciting?)

 You asked me if train goes east
 
We locked eyes.  You asked me if train went east. I told you it was end of the line.
On the train you moved and sat beside me.  I asked you if you were ok and knew where you were going.
You said you moved because of the sun.
You were gorgeous.  Id love to hangout sometime.

You were working at the \"Chocolate\" event tonight. We met at the end. Wish I asked you out then. Lets grab a drink.
  
  
 Apple Store Eaton Centre
 
Hey
You helped me clean my phone without an appointment 
You look like a certain actor from my favourite TV show. 
You're extremely cute
If you're here by all means reply with what actor you look like and what I said afterwards.
  
  
 You complimented my tattoos
 
Last Wednesday July 29th I was coming home around 8:50/9pm
You were walking west on Roehampton. 
You told me you like my tattoos. 
I looked back and saw that you looked back as well. 
You are gorgeous and were wearing a red hat.

But that afternoon he asked himself, with his infinite capacity for illusion, if such pitiless indifference might not be a subterfuge for hiding the torments of love.
  
  
 The petite girl on the Bloor-danforth line at 7pm
 
This is a long shot but who knows.
I noticed you when you got on the train at Kennedy station on the Bloor-Danforth line around 7pm this evening thursday. You are petite with blonde hair and glasses, you were wearing all black with white birkenstocks. I really like your style. I know you noticed me too ;-)
You got off at Victoria park station and our eyes met as you were leaving the train. I wish I smiled but you caught me by surprise. 
Reply to this by telling me what shirt I was wearing. I would love to meet and grab a coffee.
I take that train every day both ways so if I see you again I will talk to you.
Hope you get his

 Curran Hall Tennis
 
You were leaving as we were coming onto the courts Tuesday night. You were giving lessons? 
You were so cute and I thought you were looking.  If so .. A bit of info about me or time to move things along is cool. 
Hope to chat.
  
  
 Asian Girl
 
I use to play with a sexy Asian girl for cash but you weren't a pro. I would love to see you again. You were from Mississauga. I have money for you ;). Would love to see you again for some play.
  
  
 Gorgeous slim and slender East Indian girl at Starbucks downtown.
 
Hey,
You were the East Indian chick wearing a dark dress who walked into the Starbucks at One Bedford Street (across from the St. George subway off Bloor St) earlier this evening around 9 PM. 
You had long dark hair and you were wearing a one-piece dark dress. 
You walked in with a dude, but he looked more like a platonic friends or a brother! Haha!
If you happen to see this posting, then I'd love to hear from you! ;-)
xoxo

  
  
 Brunette flight attendant on her first day of the job
 
Realistically, you'll never see this, but it's cathartic for me to type it out. I'm kicking myself over not asking for your number when we were both standing around waiting for a shuttle. You got on a different shuttle cab than I did, and must have gotten off before terminal 1.
Guess I'll never get to tell you about how adorable that lip-bite you do when pacing down the aisle is.
  
  
 Chocolate man at cinema tower
 
We met in the elevator,  as soon as I saw you I blushed. You are a  gorgeous black man! You said hello Molly!  And my friend and I smiled and said hi. I couldn't help to keep silent and I said: do you smell like chocolate?  ( I didn't mean to sound racist) you lol and said: its cocoa butter. .... I just wanted to take a bite of you. We left the building and I felt fuzzy because I didn't say anything else and then I saw you on the street and waved bye(I never thought you would see me) and you look at me smile and waved bye too... it's a long shot but I have to give it a try and wait for your reply

 SITTING IN YOUR CAR
 
Wednesday night around 8:30..I was walking south along Carlaw with a friend..I saw you sitting in your car. We locked eyes for a bit until I couldn't see you. You are very handsome!
I turned back and you had driven off.

 Bartender at The Bottom Line
 
I came in with some buddies after a company meeting, and you served us beers. I just wanted to say that you have the cutest smile I have ever seen, I also love your piercings just below your lower lip. I couldn't keep my eyes off you, and I think you caught me staring a few times too!  
I was numb all over, purely and completely mesmerized by you and just wanted you to know that you made my week.
  
  
 ....there you go...again...again...
 
....longing, interesting word. I'm not so sure it's the right one, but maybe....
  
  
 New Canadian
 
We were at the ceremony today.
I was with my wife in the line-up right behind you. You were alone.
Later you were in the row ahead of me and we wished each other at the end.
We were in the same elevator going down as well.
I thought we had a connection.....

 Broken things
 
Brok3n hearts br0ken thumbs broken smiles brok3n promises br0ken minds broken men and broken glass. 
I was so close to just leaving the park without feeding into your talks of shit. So close. But when i left, or started to...you got louder and nastier (including threatening to \"break my head\ plus the disgusting remark you made about my beloved dog) and since I was still holding my glass tea bottle, i surprised you with a quick sharp right turn straight for you. You didn't have enough tim3 to run or duck and i pegged you and showered you with glass. (You did that to me once last year....while i was sleeping...outside). 
Just yesterday you emailed me asking to have sex and saying u love me. And just a few days ago you said you're with the fat bitch and that you are disgusted by me.
Milk crates....glass jars....a dagger that one time i attacked you for threatening to mess with my family and their home....plus the rolled up magazine.....bare hands squeezing throat....one day one of us will go too far. 
I sincerely just want to be left alone. Please. 
Whats red and bad for your teeth? Bricks. 
You are careless. You sleep outside in my hood when you have a house one town over. You play \"music\" full blast on your piece of shit earbuds. You sit with your back to the vulnerable side. You yell and chatter to yourself constantly. Your almost always drunk or spun or burnt or stoned. And you stopped eating. 
I have meditated on the ways i could hurt you for countless hours over the years. The only thing stopping me is sanity and morality and discretion. But you will push until i snap. Lord help us 

  
  
 I got a tattoo to remember you by
 
It's on my left forearm. I got in july 2013. My great grand father gathered some love poems for my great grandmother and he wrote them out in this beautiful writing in this little book. I have the first two lines of that poem on my arm. i like your tattoos and I regret that I didn't ask you to tell me what they all mean  when I saw you last. I'm sure you have really cool reasons because getting a tattoo really hurts. I'm sure you wouldnt put just anything on your body.
  
  
 Caddy smelled like trees
 
I felt so lonely when I first came to Canada. It felt as if I suddenly became deaf and mute overnight and found myself in this strange world that I couldn't understand. It looked different, smelled different, I didn't recognize anyone. I couldn't understand anyone and nobody could understand me. I learned English pretty fast but the voice of if just sounded so foreign to me in my head. The words that I spoke had no meaning. The word heartbroken is nothing but a sound when you never had a broken heart. When I write it down it doesn't mean anything. But I now what it means to have your heart broken it really helps writing it down. I can feel the words if you know what I mean. I used to keep a diary as a kid because I felt that I couldn't really talk to anyone. I always felt so out of place and so insecure because I didn't how to truly get along with anyone. I got along with myself though. I felt no shame when writing down words on paper because a paper won't judge you. People will which is why you should delete your reddit account right now. Save what you wrote though so that you can look at it and feel ashamed for whoring yutself . You can't be a good writer if you can't be honest with yourself. Isn't that the point if writing to begin with? I'm just asking, actually. I'd love to know what you think good writing is. Though I have a fair idea since I learned it all from you :)
I believe that there is this warm place buried deep in our chest. It feels like little flames are tickling the inside of my ribcage. Breaking your heart gets that fire started.
You cracked it open on December 31, 2012 when you responded to my POF message. I think I still remember what I wrote. I said something like: Hey I know that look on your face, I'm making the same face. I went into some kind of trance when I saw your picture. I looked straight into your eyes and I thought they were the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. I thought they are the most calming shade of blue I've ever seen. I saw that color in the sky once when I was at my mom's. I was sitting out on the windowsill, smoking a cigarette. I felt so weird. I mean I was at home but I wasn't. I felt no connection to the place anymore because it changed so much. It was around 4 in the morning and I just finished binge watching Orange is the Black on my ipad. I couldn't sleep. I was looking at the sky and the river under it and as the first rays of sun touched the night sky, I saw that blue again and felt home. It reminded me of home and everything that home means: comfort, warmth; a cocoon. And I was in there with you. Everytime I think of you, I'm home. I don't care where I am, you can remember places when you try hard enough but home is not a place, it's a feeling and I get that everytime I think of you. I doesn't matter

 From King to Davisville subway ride
 
I met a man in a subway on July 5th (~5:30pm). We rode together from King to Davisville and had a very nice conversation, but we didn't exchange the numbers. Shawn, I'd like to meet you again! Hope I'll find you.
  
  
 Beautiful brunette at Fit for less gym - lawrence
 
Hi 
I saw you a few times at the gym. Usually working out after 4-5pm. I feel like there's some connection there but I'm too shy to ask you out:(
You normally wear black legging:) 
You're really cute . If you're reading this , hit me up:) 

  
  
 Kavi
 
I see you occasionally. You're a stunning, beautiful, tall, light skin girl. Big smile, luminous eyes. I'm not sure of your nationality, Guyanese or South Asian perhaps. I usually see you on Fridays or Saturdays. I always want to ask you out, however you are usually surrounded by your co workers,  I dont want to put you on the spot at your work. I am white, tall, we are right around the same age I would imagine. I see you at your work near Danforth and Main st. in the Beaches area. I always order for pick up:) See this Kavi and let the rest fall into place.

 BEARDED GUY SELLING BURRITOS AT WINTERSLEEP CONCERT
 
Hey! Hoping you'll see this but who knows.
You were selling Mexican food... or burritos... I didn't ever actually come close enough to see, near the back of the floor in the Phoenix last night during the show. Wintersleep, Hannah Georgas & Brothers of the North were playing. All were pretty rad, as I'm sure you could hear :) but what caught my attention more was you... after the bands finished, my friend and I were walking by you ... she was looking in another direction, but I was looking over at you and smiling a little... and you smiled back ... the best smile ever... and it totally melted me. I wish I said something to you but I got super shy... kinda told my friend to stay for a few minutes just so I could look at you again haha. And I stood at a diagonal to you just thinking about that smile and how handsome you are. Had a weird feeling like we would probably connect well if we did talk.... Kicking myself now!! Anyway, you were wearing a grey toque and sorta skate shoes? You had dark hair and a beard. I have long dirty blonde hair. 
Tell me what I was wearing and a picture so I know it's you! Would love to hang out and actually have a conversation.
Cheers!
  
  
 I offered you my seat
 
Hey,
I saw you last night on my way home from class on the spadina streetcar. I was a sweaty dishelved mess too busy on my phone to realize you were walking with a cane and (from what I could tell) no one had offered you their seat so I got up and offered you mine, which you politely declined. But you were kind enough to bid me a goodnight when you got off at harbord.
I swear to all hell I'm not a creeper. I normally don't do this but you're stunning and seemed like a really cool down to earth person. If you don't have a GF I'd like to take you for tea or coffee or an apparatif. If you do, I respect boundaries and don't mind making some new friends.  
Hope you got to your destination safely!
  
  
 Beauty on line two from Young to Coxwell.
 
You got on my train today at around 5:45. Tall blond, blue shirt, white shirt, and tan shoes, sunglasses, you were the most beautiful women to ever step foot on a train, we shared quite a few glances and I made a seat available too you to chat with you, but an old man stole it. 
We talked in the coxwell bus bay, but I was in a rush because I had to get back on the train, and didn't have a chance to ask you for your number. 
Id love to hear from you.

 No Frills (Cheese)
 
Hey :)
You were the cute guy at the No Frills at Kennedy/Eglinton today.
You asked me if I knew where the round cheese was. I tried to help but couldn't find it.
There was a bit of miscommunication at first because I struggled a bit with what you were saying and you haf a bit of difficulty understanding my English.
If this is you please message back :)
What was the colour of my hair? Or something else so I know it's you.

Either ways if u ever look at these postings would love to meet you for more.

Anyway, you sat there eating by yourself, and I thought you were pretty cool =)

Hey - sorry I've been MIA lately. It was really great getting to know you - I feel a connection and I think you're amazing. To be honest, I've got a lot going on and am not in a place in my life right now where I'm ready for anything serious. I can't promise I'll call if or when things get better but for now I'm just focusing on working things out. I hope you understand.
  
  
 Looking for someone I knew :) think go train.
 
I am looking for an older man I knew a little while back. 
You and I had some fun but I was always too shy. I was wondering if you would like to meet again :-). It's been some time so maybe you are now seeing someone. 
You like apple products, Asian food, Asians.. And seem to always be working alone! Hehe 
At any rate I thought I'd try. Chances are slim but let's see if you see this!
  
  
 G Ross Park June 1st
 
We met at G Ross park (Dufferin and Finch) at midnight night on Wednesday, June 1st. You were the only one there when I came to the first parking lot. I gave you head and you shot your load in my mouth. All I know is that you are married and originally from Yugoslavia and wish I had gotten your contact information. You had a nice one and want to do it again. Let me know what you were wearing if interested in meeting again.

 Tuesday night islington bus north
 
We were both on islington 37 bus around 5:30-5:45.  You sat at front I stood infront of you.
You were dark skinned...not sure of ethnicity though.  Green pants and black top.  Sandals and hoop earrings.  A gold ring on your right hand middle finger.
We locked eyes twice.  You are gorgeous.  Beyond gorgeous.  Unbelievably stunning.
I'd love to see you again.  Perhaps a date?

 chelsea where are you?
 
We met at work. Had many great nights together. I had a girl but never forgot about you. Hope all is well. I had a place above a store when we met and the last time I saw you was at ur place in Toronto.
  
  
 the guy who yelled down the hole
 
Man, that made my day. Usually all I get is bullshit about blocking lanes, am I the reason why their phone went out or just bitching about the company I work for. Your good words were unexpected, and welcome.
I promised myself that I'd pay the good feeling forward. So I let a few people get in front of me on the way home. There's a good deed coming up for someone tomorrow too.
So you keep on keepin' on, good karma comes back!

 Revival - Blond w/ Nipple Ring
 
We danced close to one another for much of the night at Revival. You were tall, blond, with a nipple ring, and I'm pretty sure intentionally dancing close to me. I never made my move but kicking myself so here I am. 
Not even sure if you live in Toronto or travelling from out of town but write if you see this. Mention some defining characteristic of me if you think you know which guy I am.
  
  
 Freckles and Grey Shirt Saturday Pride
 
I was walking with my friends down Church Street on Saturday, July 2nd, and I got passed by this man who wore a tight grey shirt that wrapped his body beautifully. He had red/strawberry blond hair and his arms were pale and filled freckles and at one point I caught him looking down at his right hand where he was carrying a big fiji water bottle. I couldn't get him off my mind and now I'm thinking maybe I should've talked to him, but hey... I'm shy and get nervous... I hope to see this beautiful man again.

 Tattooed Brunette on a Timmies run this morning
 
You were grabbing a quick snack from Tim Hortons this morning, I was the guy in glasses and a black toque reading. You had amazing tattoos. We caught eyes for a second, and I was too shy to say anything - but you're gorgeous, and life is short. So, if you see this and you're interested, drop me a line and tell me what colour my shirt was, and maybe we can grab a coffee together next time?

 Gwar THE monster
 
darkened earth
pessimism lurking
ground i'd see.. full  laid and brown
end my happiness with a frown
everlastin sparse... crowds r fully dispersed
find me under my treee
though i am alone i am surrounded by all alike
drinking wine thru an apple  juice straw
Gwar  the midnight monsters approach
Dogs by the leash
human animals in toe
doing what i want....as soon  as i find my spot
Getting buzzed dead on arrival
...i am ready to haunt
my own prescription for living
inhaling Gwar, i feel u on me
reach my lungs
urrr   much too far
Gwar is everything
Gwar is everywhere
the rumbling begins to soar
faintly penetrating the music moves with all who stand still
cant deny u
call me closer
she jumpss  to fly
she jumpss to fall
even though she misses
he grabs her inside  and opens her lips
...while he kisses
 he kisses  her more
 all she feared
darkened earth
  
  
 Hoping you saw me
 
I'm here for the same reason you are. Hoping someone saw me, really saw me...
I'm hoping you saw my heart, my smarts, my sense of humor. I hope you saw through the practiced look on my face, I hope you were distracted by my eyes and I hope you saw my mischievous smile. 
I'm here for the same reason as you. Looking to find a connection in the crowd, the same way you are.
  
  
 Girl with the flowery outfit

 7 hour flight & I didn't ask your name
 
We sat next to each other on a 7+ hour flight on June 23. I have no idea of you're married (although you weren't wearing a ring), and you might be a bit older than me, but I thought you were fun/interesting to chat with. Can't believe I didn't even ask your name when we parted ways for our connections. Since tons of people take flights, a hint about our flight: there was a funny incident with your friend's shoe. This is a long shot, but if you read this, I'd love to chat again!
  
  
 are you the one I'm looking for
 
Have you ever had your pussy licked right , have you ever had an orgasm that had your body convulsing , your lips quivering , your toes curled and your mind perplexed. Imagine for a moment , my lips kissing you from your breasts , to your stomach , slowly kissing above your clit , in between your thighs while i begin to press my tongue gently , but firmly on your clit. Ill start slow making circle motions with my tongue pressed on your clit and as your body starts to get hot, your pussy wet , i will begin not lick inside your pussy , sucking on your clit , making my tongue go in all directions while your clit throbs , your pussy aches and your mind is just wanting more and more. Ill have you lick my fingers , as i put them in your wet , tight , hot pussy and finger you with the tips of my fingers pressed on your g spot. Now the question is have you had it done right ... message me and ill have your pussy given what it really deserves. Ill share pictures with you and info one you message me
  
  
 Sunnyside boardwalk runner
 
You were jogging along the Sunnyside boardwalk after 8pm and you passed me twice while you were running. We gave each other a good glance and nodded both times. You are really handsome and i would have liked to have been on that run with you.
You were wearing dark coloured shirt and shorts, I was wearing a green and white striped tank top.
Hope you find this ;)
  
  
 Photographer at Joey Sherway on Canada Day
 
You were taking pictures outside Joey at Sherway around 7:30 pm. You came up to the patio upstairs. I thought I caught you looking so I looked away. When I looked back, you were still looking and smiling. I think you had a pink shirt on and it looks like you drove a Honda Odyssey. 
Do you remember anything about me? Want to get a drink?
  
  
 hidden fromu
 
Falling for it... I cannot escape. exciting and new. it never leaves. its kinda scary, its obsessive, its just a feeling so strange, scared and nervous.
Overcome
U are secret to my mind
I wish to tell
But i am embarrassed as hell
So take me for my word
It's so hard to try
An escapable thing for which I only know to deny
If not now
But b4 I look ahead.. one more day... into a sun filled sky
I feel to my heart.... I continually lie
But I barely see now
Till then
It seems as if time becomes more meaningless
I hope again & again... till the end of the way the inside of my brain starts to bend
I pl;an it against me
A force to make me 
A challenge to make me free
I know Its not right
So this is sthing I must fight
But i must ask
Can I have thee chance 
Before I am 
>>>>>>>>>>>.....OVERCOME
if i stop would it be... so instead i question everyday the way i stay
would u run to run 
would u exist or leave wher a could be endured 
a moth hidden in a fabric
ready to dia=gram the disappearance of what feeling could be felt
the smell of the air
the angled face obscured by your hair
u make it hard to breath
u make me nervous
u make me scared
what tisssssss??? that
no way what to control words that are sent
in a life it passes but it will never have went
my heart is seldom... this is my random
Overcome
U are a secret...to my mind
I wish to tell
do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers
  
  
 You live next door... (long shot?)
 
Hi,
You live next door. You have a husband, but I've seen you change in front of the window many times.
This turns me on to no end. I have no idea if this is intentional or not, but just know, that I'm completely DOWN with it.
I live in the east end of Toronto. Let me know if this is you.
  
  
 ISSS it A tREASURE THT findss U
 
You have nothing to lose. Love never goes away. You think constantly, everyday.. all the time. Love is the most important thing a precious few have the privilege to experience. To love is to become lost in it, no matter how you question reality, past, present and future. Weakened for an eternity, no set of rules, exclusions or formalities of circumstance can ever change it. Love is real when u have it, nothing else matters. THE BEST PART IS.............. THAT ITS YOURS AND NO ONE CAN EVER TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU.

 Cute brunette wearing a blue / green skirt at OISE - U of T downtown.
 
Hey there,
You were the cutie asking some friends for the directions to the exit around 9 PM this evening (Monday). LOL
I think you had a class on the third floor. 
You were incredibly cute. :)
If you happen to see this, then I'd love to hear from you! ;-)
xoxo

  
  
 sunglasses
 
I entered your store to buy glasses. You seemed reluctant then walked up and assisted me. You were beautiful and I hope this missed connection was about you, however, it was not, because well you can do much better.
This is more about the missed connection with the pair of glasses. See, I would have gone home with a pair today. One of the pairs you had recommended. In fact, the moment you said, \"This one looks good,\" I would have been sold. However, you had to add a while later, \"You look good in that one.\"
Now, I know you are a saleswoman so you need to close the deal, but why lie

 Redhead who biked past me tonight (w/a blue helmet I think?)
 
We have to do it again, you forgot to stop so we could talk. Or we could go for a drink?
  
  
 we met at Glad Day last summer but I lost yr contact info #enby4enby
 
We met at Glad Day bookstore last summer, after a reading by Amber Dawn, Sassafras Lowrey, & Alec Butler.
You complimented my purple hair, & after talking for a few minutes, we exchanged names (ours were very similar!), & you realized you knew who I was, and told me you'd recently read one of my books, which you'd stolen from your ex-wife and traveled across the country with. We both got capital-E Emotional.
I said let's hang out for real instead of just talking about hanging out and never seeing each other again like so many queers in Toronto, but then I lost your contact info. I asked a few pals about you, to no avail. Whether or not you still wanna hang out, I wanted to let you know that I haven't forgotten you, and I hope the city is being kind to you.
  
  
 if you're kinky and you know it.
 
Don't be a missed connection, if you're kinky and want to explore with me, don't hesitate. Sane and fun.
Conversation first. Some kind of friendship first.
  
  
 you, the black guy who crossed my path
 
Sometime after 5pm today, we crossed paths, you were a black guy who lifted his shirt and you caught me checking out your sexy stomach... you smiled and said Hi, I also smiled and said hi back and you kept going. I looked back but you did not... maybe you were just flattered by the attention, but if you found me attractive too I'd love to hear from you. I'm the white guy with the sheepish smile. :P
  
  
 Ken, drummer from Mother Tongues
 
Hi Ken, you are a babe. You asked if I was single at the show you played at Handlebar and I wasn't single at the time, but now I am, and I would like to make out with you. I hope you get this!

I think we live in the same building 
Anyway if ya read this and had the same attraction I did
Lemme know what I bought at the store that the lady gave me a discount
Have a nice day! ;)
  
  
 I miss you and think of you often
 
I wasn't ready for you to come into my life... I was selfish and didn't deserve the attention you gave me.  I wish I could turn back the hands of time and start fresh with you... 
I hope Sherlock is well

hey, we connected last night over a bouncing ball. My boyfriend was there also, but did not stop you from coming on to me. Think your name was Joseph
  
  
 Beautiful mom with kid at the Pride Parade last July 3
 
We were standing at the guard rail almost infront of Sunset Grill watching the parade, having fun. 
You were wearing white shirt, sunglasses and had curly hair. You were with your kid. Your kid wore a cap with a skull logo on it. 
I was the Asian standing behind you with a buddy. 
If you happen to read this, please do reply. I'd like to get in touch with you. Coffee? Lunch? Dinner?
  
  
 Canada Day 2016 Warrior Women in Toronto
 
A few nights ago, on Canada Day July 1st 2016 at around 2:30am (so July 2nd technically) when the drunk crowds started flocking out of the clubs, two girls, Lilly and Sophie (I think I remember them saying), were harassed by a big black guy, about 6'5\" and wearing a red shirt, on the corner of Ossington Ave and Dundas St West. 
The girls rejected him and he lashed out, throwing Lilly to the ground and hitting Sophie across the face. I watched from half a block away across the street and ran towards them as a few other men jumped in to protect the girls. The guy began swinging and hitting the men who were jumping in. 
By the time I was close, a cop arrived and the guy fled. The cop chased the guy down the street while I stayed and spoke to Lilly and Sophie who were still shook up from the fight. We waited about 15 minutes for the cop to return with the guy in hand cuffs, but he didn't return at all, and after saying they were okay, the girls thanked me and went on their way. 
I kept thinking about how shook up they were, and I regretted not helping them home, or taking down their information. If by some long shot you're reading this, or if you know about this incident and know the girls involved, please reply. Would love to reach out somehow, just to ask them if they're okay now, and if they want to hang out under normal and happier circumstances, I'm down. If not, that's cool too, but I wish I had done more that night. The guy was insane and the girls didn't deserve that.

 Brown boy -- TTC subway -- you got off at Yorkdale -- 1245 AM on Jul 4
 
Dude . . . we wanted you.
I'm guessing you're Guyanese, but that's just an educated guess.
Why didn't you come sit down beside us or stay on the train? We actually waited for you at Downsview hoping you'd get off on the next train.
We're the two white guys that were sitting across from you. The way you lingered when you got off the train and stared back at us was such a huge turn-on. Hope you saw the wave as the subway sped off.
If you see this, tell us what colour your tie was.
PS You're really, really fucking cute and you looked great :)

Hey Hey, 
We cruised each other pretty hard but I miss the connection! I'm a bald dude with a beard, probably shirtless, hit me up if you're interested.
  
  
 Missing you
 
The same people are posting fake and general \"missing\" ads to lure the broken hearted for their own amusement. If that person truly wanted to speak to you it wouldn't be over C.L. 
Be careful what you share on here. 
It can be a desperate woman posting as a man and vice versa.
For every \"missing\" ad there is usually 10+ replies.
  
  
 PIT BULL Carnival - Kissing Bandit
 
We kissed a lot on the dancefloor from the moment I arrived. Then we got separated. You came to say goodbye but I didn't get your number. It didn't end right... Sorry! Looked for you on Pride day but didn't see you.  Hope to find you. Xx
  
  
 Dark room fuck two wknds in a row
 
Last Friday night/early Saturday, you saw me in the shower at Steamworks, I sucked you in the hallway, then you fucked your cum into me in the dark room. This weekend, you fucked me again, same place, and said that this time, you wanted to get my contact info so we could play again. We took a break so some other guys could fuck me in the sling, but you had to go before we had a chance to finish things. We haven't even swapped names. If you happen to see this, flip me an email so you can keep on using my cummy hole.
And if this wasn't you, but I sound like the kind of slutty bottom you'd like to stick your dick in, feel free to hit me up as well. Only if you fuck raw, though. Condoms are a dealbreaker for me. Sorry.

 PAIN couple at FLY
 
Fly Sunday night end of Pride, at Fly. I gave the dom a thumbs up during the pain, and a look of \"what the f_ _ _???\" when the security person took you guys away. You were incredible. I was the hairy ripped guy. I'm getting somewhat similar to what you did and would love to meet, even just to exchange ideas.

 Regrets about you
 
Do I regret meeting you?
Yes and no.
I regret that I'll never know what it's like to take you out, to have dinner with you, or a date with you. You changed me quite a lot.
We would have made a fun couple I think.
Regret is meeting someone you've literally dreamed about and not being able to do anything about it.
I really, sincerely, wish you nothing but happiness on whatever road you're currently on.
If our paths cross again, say hi, and I'll say hi back.
But I do regret meeting you, because now I know you exist.

 Dear Kyle the Chronic Hiccupper
 
I was at a house party somewhere near-ish Chinatown on the very late late evening of Canada Day. I met the funniest person in the world who had a condition where he would interrupt breathing, talking,and regular normal functioning with hiccups. Also he did not like Jurassic World. Please message if you know this person. 
-Cheers
  
  
 Ryan from Missouri
 
You were standing alone looking studly at the Bear Garden on Pride Saturday - I chatted you up for a bit, and you told me you'd just moved here from St Louis, and I started talking about the St Paul sandwich (which you had mysteriously never heard of?!)
You were sweet and adorable! And I'm bummed I didn't get your number, silly me. Say hey!

 Dude with the backpack smoking by Bathurst Station
 
About an hour ago. You were wearing pale red jeans maybe? You got off at dufferin or ossington, I can't remember. You wore a black belt and black shoes, backpack.
You looked back as you left the subway, I was wearing the brown suede skirt.
  
  
 519 Green
 
You were the blond guy wearing navy blue shorts and have a nice smile. Not sure if you wanted to chat/make a move but I kept dancing with my lady friend, whom I dragged to Pride with. If you read this, tell me what I wore and what I look like. 
Ps. the missed connection happened around 9 pm on Sunday by the fenced stage.
  
  
 my birthday - are you that special female?
 
Hey There,
This is all I am saying right now!
My birthday this month is on a Sunday.....looking to hang out with a good looking female between 37 and 42 years (give or take a couple years is fine).
Attracted to blondes, brunettes and redheads..... trust me I can still turn heads and get hit up when me and my friends go out but have not met that special female.....YET.
If serious write back but don't ask for a picture cause would not ask for yours and would not send mine on CL!
We can describe each other physically.

 Sheppard Subway Eastbound
 
We were travelling eastbound on the Sheppard subway.  You sat comfortably with your leg up on the two-seater.  You had on a gay-themed white T-shirt... sorry I don't know what it said cause I was busy looking at your handsome face.  We acknowledged each other through winks and a few short words.  Interested in coffee?
  
  
 Happy Birthday
 
I hope you're where you wanted to be by the time this day came.
I miss you.  I know I'm stupid for it, but I do.

 Blue Jays game: Tim Hortons
 
I have never posted on here... But here it goes...
You were in line right behind me, I think with your mom. You stood behind me and I pretended not to notice as you two hinted at how tall I am. Our eyes met many times in that lineup and for whatever reason I didn't say anything.... But wish I did. You were in a Jays shirt, no name on it and more than just the logo on the front.
Let me know what player-shirt I was wearing, or any other details so I know it's you...
  
  
 Baseera
 
We met yesterday at the park, you were hanging out on the swings (waiting for someone?) when my sons decided to make a new friend. Thanks for being so good with them, it meant a lot. I feel stupid for not getting your number, you were so cheerful and fun. Their mother isn't in the picture, I should have been more clear about that. This is a long shot but msg me if you catch this, I would love to get to know you.
  
  
 Maria (Marie?)
 
We met a few weeks back at the park, but my boys were exhausted so we didn't get to keep chatting. Your boy Jack was so cute, I wish my sons had more like him to play with. You mentioned your folks have to watch him cuz you work and you're not always around. We've been keeping an eye out for you in the local parks since then, but no luck. Anyways I thought you were really cool and I wish I had grabbed some contact info. This is a long shot and not something I've ever done before, but reply if you wanna hang out some time (with my name or one of my boys if you can remember). Cheers

faded from my belief
turning over an old leaf
running down the hill that once scared me from an unknown thrill
now slightly slower but much faster
LIFES COVERED IN   a CAST
MADE OUT OF  SCABS .... ANdd PLASTER
THINGS of  dreams .. una mes amor sin amar
travell travell .. burning feet on gravel

tinsel burning
recANTED scents from a stenchfull yearning
lost to years of  selfless appreciation
just another of the same ol shit

 Pitbull muscle
 
At pitbull dance (leather) on Friday night, I was the guy in jock and harness - and you were one of a few guys who watched my abs getting punched.  It's totally what I'm into, so thanks for asking about it.  I'll be at Fly tonight (Sunday) for the last pitbull dance.   Haven't decided what I'll wear but my  black Everlast  boxing boots are very likely.  I won't shave off my scruff with some silver. Hope to meet the guys who thought my muscle punching scene is hot.
  
  
 May from Coda last night
 
We danced for a little bit before you got pulled away by your girlfriend. You had such a stunning pixie cut accentuated by the headband (that you told me you remade from a wig hahaha). I couldn't take my eyes off you. Would love to have coffee sometime. Message me with what shirt I was wearing
PS our dance-off was definitely not over!!

Tell me what I was wearing :)

Please let me know what else about your wardrobe that I liked and maybe let me know what I was wearing and hopefully we can connect. I would love to spend some quality time with both of you!
  
  
 Searching for Erica
 
We met last early march, I picked you up from a rehab facility on vancouver island and drove you to the ferries, we shared a lot of conversation and intimate moments, you have short curly blonde hair. We had such a connection. I was hoping we would keep in touch as you had to go back to toronto to be with family. Find me Erica.

Please be back in touch.
  
  
 college station north 130am
 
I was waiting on the northbound platform with my bf. I had a bike. You were a cute younger guy in a white shirt and shorts. Also had a coke bottle in your hand. There was entertainment across the platform. We kept making eye contact but I was a bit drunk so didn't say anything. When the subway came I parked my bike in the doorway and you stood right beside me. you got off at wellesley or bloor. long shot, but if its you say hey.

 You lost your shoes I gave you my sock
 
This happen less than 2 hrs ago, we talk at the very end of the king street car, you lost your shoes and other items and your friends tell me to give you my shoes. We compromise and I gave you my socks so you can walk home. I also gave you  one of the wristband from digital dreams. We didn't exchange any info and I regretted it, hopefully you or your friend will see this. You took the bus going west while I went east :(
