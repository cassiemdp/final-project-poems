Heres a little story id like to tell about
How slow it all happened
Unnoticed and forgotten
Lost in the amazement
A shadow that trailed them
Sunshine and happiness
Laughter without guilt
No need for arguments
They understood and embraced the difference
But time was widdling Away
Ignorant and confident
It was not to be compared
And they agreed it was different
With promises of openness
Sealed with a. Kiss
Romeo and Juliet 
Without the death
They were joined at the hip
And in tune as it gets
From the very beginning
They were brand new kids
Adults in the orchard
And living under the same roof
Brought together by madness
Drunken confidence 
And loneliness 
Both missing tenderness
Hurt by what's happened
And ready to forget everything
Exactly what they were asking for
They were almost Leary of how perfect it was
And he almost didn't let it happen
But she was determined 
And it all happened
Promised commitment
And together till the end of it
He was romantic
And she the purest form of acceptance
They bloomed and blossomed so quick
He was her confidence that she lost in the wind
And she was his everything he never had as a kid
It could not have been a more balanced relationship
And a mushroom trip sealed it
Their spirits intertwined as they watched their friends dance to the music
Convinced it couldn't be coincidence 
And if it was didn't give a shit
They had no reason for desricptions or time for second thinking
Their only ambition was to be in it
In ways they had never been
Fully commited in every minute
An almost impossible challenge that many have challenged and very few have lasted
They stood proud as lovers and took off on an adventure that would be as spontaneous and unforgettable as the moment they met
Days of asking how they became the person the person eachother was so in love with
And nights of wondering how lucky they were to have found this
It was as if nothing before had ever happened
And they Held back nothing 
It was hurtful in ways but empowering more than anything
Each day passing was more proof they made the right decision 
She was captivated by him and all his goofy conversations 
And he was in awe of her and all the ways she lit up any room she was in
Time passed by as usual but was decorated with moments of slow motion that would forever be in their memories 
If ever there was anything greater
Let it be forever unknown to the lovers
Who cares when all is theirs
To the love slaves
There is no greater
Only theirs
Asian woman, southbound from St. George to Queen's Park
We were standing beside each other on the subway this morning, me sneaking sideways glances at you, you noticing and smiling. You were wearing a white tshirt and black pants, I was wearing a light blue t and blue pants. I commented on how hot you are and you smiled, but I got super nervous. As we walked down the tunnel you turned to go to UHN (or so your badge indicated) I went to the university. You were absolutely stunning and I cannot get your smile and body out of my mind! If you see this, maybe we can have lunch?
Southbound Subway (Monday Morning)
Hey,
I got on the yonge-line south bound Monday morning around 10:30. I was standing near the door and noticed we kept making eye contact. Eventually I sat down across from you and we continued to make eye contact whenever we had the chance. 
You got off at King and I stayed on till Union. 
You had on a shirt with a company logo on it and you were carrying a particular bag - let me know what each of them was so I know it's you. 
Would love to chill sometime.
Your green dress this morning...
Good morning! I saw you walking your dog this morning. Your green dress, that long hair falling on your arms....was the thing that makes my day. I know you are in relationship however I just want to tell you that you are so beautiful! Enjoy your day
I'll bring the wine next time
I saw you yesterday on the subway and couldn't stop thinking about you afterwards. I had a small table with me,we talked about how we love finding great things around this city. And that a glass of wine would complete the commute. You were very cute and seem like a nice woman. Would love to get to know you.
You got off at high park station.
I hope that you'll see this. 
Air conditioner
Hi...do you remember me? I'm the guy who came to help you moving from the basement to the apartement on the 6th or 7th floor...then i came after 1 or 2 weeks to install the air conditioner....if u remember me...contact me
Looking for Tiffany/Sandra

Re. 'M'
why feel bad and used for opening up?  was trust betrayed?  sharing a pc of your heart is a gift that is as precious as it is rare.  don't be ashamed.
Guiness' Mom
You were at Cherry Beach on Monday.   I was there with my brother and my dog.   We chatted for a bit,  should have asked for your number.
On my motorcycle behind you
I couldn't hear what you were asking me when you leaned out your window and said something to me, I had music playing in my headphones. My bike was the same colour as your SUV, hope you see this, I want to know what you said and tell you I thought you were gorgeous.
A bit of random perversion, anyone?
 
You're walking peacefully down the quiet street. Houses on both sides, but little signs of life outside the yellow-illuminated glass that separates the neighbourhood from the passersby. It's calm and relaxing. You glance at time to time at the gardens, the houses. Even then, you are alone.
You continue, mindless and mindful. Another house, its porch alight, catches your eye. And there you spot the first person you've come across on your walk. A sexy bald guy in just his pyjama bottoms. Stroking his big, hard cock.
Want the address

  
  
 TTC 501 - You waved, I nodded yes.
 
TTC - 501 Dundas Street West car.  Around 8:30pm Tuesday, August 16.  You got off at the Queensway. I went North on Roncy.
There was a screaming child.  You smiled, she smiled, I smiled. 
Wanted to say Hi but didn't know how, considering.  You too, I think.  Eye contact was nice.  I got off at next stop and went back but didn't see you. 
It's hard to find a good man, perhaps you are one?
  
  
 To my ex husband
 
I love you so much and to this day miss you terribly.  It is still so hard to believe that we are not together.  I am not angry, or hurt, or bitter in any way. I still believe we are mean't to be, and someway, somehow, it will happen again soon.  When you come back, I promise you, you will be embraced with nothing but support and love and acceptance. I promise with all my heart.  We are often told as children that as long as we have hope, anything is possible. Yet as adults, we so easily give up on our hopes and dreams. Well I won't.  I often fantasize telling our future children how you and I were apart and somehow managed to make it back together.  I also fantisize about how different, how peaceful and how beautiful our second chance will be. Day and night, 24/7 I think about you.  I pray to God that you are okay, and that you will return to me.  Life is too hard without you by my side. So much has changed, and I long to share all these moments with you.  I miss you and love you with all my heart. There will never be another, only you.  Please come back soon.
  
  
 Hey you! The pretty woman! One and only!!!
 
Not sure why I am doing this? Just to tell you that you are the most sexy and hot girl I have ever seen in my life. Too bad that I am married and older than you. You may be an Arab or Persian beauty. We often go down or up on the same elevator and I never got the courage to say Hi or compliment you about your flawless beauty. I just look down so that you may not read my eyes. I admire you always in my thoughts and will always.
Your silent Admirer.

 
your a psychic vampire with nothing inside who thinks that publically insulting me or my current girlfriend makes you cool. you bully people and tell everyone your the victim. people see through you. your not smart enough to pull it off or to notice how everyone sees you.
what is it like to be so empty and frightened inside?
keep it up and you will find yourself alone. you will burn everyone because you think its all about you. its not. your nothing but a sad alcoholic.
  
  
 Asian Dude at Goodlife
 
Today around 5pm saw you working out, Asian dude black shorts and ink on your arm and back. Also saw you leaving the shower stall with your underwear on, as I was sitting in the sauna around 5:30 today.
Let me know if you want to hang?
  
  
 Stacey, we talked at Y&E Wed. June 22 8pm
 
Stacey, you were walking south on Yonge then crossed to the East side on your way to meet friends. I stopped you and mentioned I found you attractive - we talked briefly but I might have mis-typed your email. I enjoyed our conversation! If you see this, please get back with contact info :^)
You have nice strawberry blonde hair (very light coloured). I have grey-blond hair, and was wearing jeans and blue polo shirt.
Chris
  
  
 Your name starts with M
 
You made me feel so bad and so used, especially since it's been years since I've opened up to anyone . I thought you were cool! No response necessary, just had to get it off my chest so I can let it go.

 Pisces vs Pisces
 
Why is it so hard to believe that connection that feels so perfect inside? 
Why do you deny yourself the chance to know
Why is it so unbelievable that somebody does care about you
Why won't you allow yourself to find out just how much
I've known you only a short time but the connection we have (had?) is real. I'm scared too letting someone in so close, let's jump bowls together and try. Future distance isn't a problem, our connection will hold.
--
If you think it's you tell me something unique about yourself that we spoke about so I know it's you.
Though you're not in the city now doesn't change what the future may hold for us if we both just stop being afraid.

 Purple Hair Female at Yonge/Bloor Subway Station
 
Time & Place
Monday, August 15
Rush hour, around 5:00pm or shortly thereafter at the Yonge/Bloor Subway Station
While standing on the platform waiting for a westbound train on the Danforth line, we stood next to each other.  You had purple, shoulder-length hair, wearing a dark top, dark pants, and open toe shoes.  I was wearing an orange shirt and jeans.  Once inside the train, you stood near one set of the sliding doors, and  I stood near the opposite set of sliding doors.  I glanced in your direction a few times, but like most people on the subway, riders avoid eye contact and look the other way.  You got off at St. George Station.  Realizing that approaching you to initiate a conversation might be startling to you, I wanted to post on here, if you browse CL from time to time --
Would love to start a conversation.  Would you be up for meeting for a coffee, tea, or another kind of beverage some time?
Cheers!

 Looking for Jennifer who used to frequent Woodbine Casino
 
I'm looking for Jennifer who used to frequent Woodbine Casino a few years ago.  She had blonde hair just past her shoulders, in her late 20's  to early 30's and was on the curvy side.  Used to see her at Woodbine casino almost everyday but haven't seen her in a few years.  Both her and I and a bunch of other regulars used to play the same game on the Game Maker machines.
I am female, my name starts with an S and I have long curly hair.
If you know Jennifer, please let her know I am looking for her.
Thank you
