Kiss\nRomeo and Juliet \nWithout the death\nThey were joined at the hip\nAnd in tune as it gets\nFrom the very beginning\nThey were brand new kids\nAdults in the orchard\nAnd living under the same roof\nBrought together by madness\nDrunken confidence \nAnd loneliness \nBoth missing tenderness\nHurt by what's happened\nAnd ready to forget everything\nExactly what they were asking for\nThey were almost Leary of how perfect it was\nAnd he almost didn't let it happen\nBut she was determined \nAnd it all happened\nPromised commitment\nAnd together till the end of it\nHe was romantic\nAnd she the purest form of acceptance\nThey bloomed and blossomed so quick\nHe was her confidence that she lost in the wind\nAnd she was his everything he never had as a kid\nIt could not have been a more balanced relationship\nAnd a mushroom trip sealed it\nTheir spirits intertwined as they watched their friends dance to the music\nConvinced it couldn't be coincidence \nAnd if it was didn't give a shit\nThey had no reason for desricptions or time for second thinking\nTheir only ambition was to be in it\nIn ways they had never been\nFully commited in every minute\nAn almost impossible challenge that many have challenged and very few have lasted\nThey stood proud as lovers and took off on an adventure that would be as spontaneous and unforgettable as the moment they met\n\nDays of asking how they became the person the person eachother was so in love with\nAnd nights of wondering how lucky they were to have found this\nIt was as if nothing before had ever happened\nAnd they Held back nothing \nIt was hurtful in ways but empowering more than anything\nEach day passing was more proof they made the right decision \nShe was captivated by him and all his goofy conversations \nAnd he was in awe of her and all the ways she lit up any room she was in\nTime passed by as usual but was decorated with moments of slow motion that would forever be in their memories \n\nIf ever there was anything greater\nLet it be forever unknown to the lovers\nWho cares when all is theirs\nTo the love slaves\nThere is no greater\nOnly theirs    "

    "details": "\nI find myself looking for your face on my screen, to no purpose other than to just see it, i can't talk to you anymore; passing by you on the street those two occasions made that clear, my body shaking in rage even when your voice is long gone your quick gaze could no longer reach me. \nI was holding on to the pain of loosing you for a year, it was me that opened the cage as you called it  you seemed too unsettled in it, I never thought you would flight right out without looking back or concern of what followed inside. It crumbled, it crushed every bone and with it my spirit But I had one memory to keep me going I knew you would not come back that was certain, probably the only thing that was back in that very dark place  but I had my memory and it was very close to my heart  I've had had love uncomplicated, undemanding love, so love really excited. \nIt was when I managed to pull myself out of the rubble when I finally was able to get air in  my lungs  without the action inciting pain , reminding me I had been walking with the dead for far too long that I had been dragged inside a shallow, cave with only one memory repeating as  you had  become my plato's cave. It was after I could finally look in the mirror and not see a broken skull with deep dark black eye sockets that you waltz in for one last act, probably the most terrible long act of cruelty in our play. You called me shallow, concerned only with the mundane yet I remember when I a found you, broken with so much will and so little strength to keep going you borrowed mine and when your only concerns were murder shows and alcohol I lend you my knowledge to navigate to safely to start your path. A path you've become a victor in. And I was proud and was\nJoyful but you were always forgetful of your past and people that had lend you a hand  so I tried not to let that notion sink in.\nThen you called me feminine and lacking of the virility you needed to find in the one you would love back. You knew I was disarmed against this words and that this accusation was the very cornerstone of deep rooted pain yet you used it to justify your lack of livido for me. And it made sense all those nights all, that time finally made sense.\nFor the first time I understood I was never the one you wanted for the first time I realized three and a half years pass by and I had not been accepted nor truly loved. \nNeedless to say this shattered my memories, you had stolen them like a very skillful thief along with everything else you had taken, but I assume a good thief always comes back to get the most precious gem, hard to resist one last blow to the head of you victim.\nSo once  again you had me on the ground, bleeding once again you walk pass me to the door. \nSadness became rage and rage translated to every single person I met I found myself having the same fight over and over with different faces. Yes I am not defined by this marketed hypermasculine society every homosexual has given into, and I'm a lot more than my clothes, one thing was true they could judge me on my clothes as that is all they knew of me, they would be almost excuse to Do so but you didn't have that protection, you had me in the palm of you hand and now I realize you might not even know my favourite, food or colour, my favourite book or designer to be completely honest I don't even think you know my birthday but then again you never even bother to learn how to pronounce my name correctly. \nSo here I am 5 years after I first saw your face on my screen for the first time, one and a half years after I open the doors and you left I finally realize I was enough, I am enough feminine clothes and all. I bestowed my love upon someone I believed was worth it and I wasn't wrong, is a shame you wasted three and a half years in someone you felt beneath you, but that is for you to remember next time. \nToday I open the cage yet again, I can no longer harbour rage, I need the space for something more fruitful. I wish you the best. I know you will reach where you want to get. \nI guess I no longer will have to wonder, if you had only loved me half of what you loved your other Mexican boy; I guess I should have taken the lyrics of the first song I kissed you to and realize, we actually did find out love in a hopeless place. \n    "

But let the guy live his life if you don't want the same things that he wanted with you. You are being incredibly selfish. Go find other people with different view points. If you treated his feelings like manure why would he want to be friends with you if you did not respect his feelings. This may or may not apply to you .

I just simply wished you got well and came to me and showed me the real value in you, and in loving you. I simply learned a hard way. . ... there is no value in you. Always just be his wife who scores off the internet while he scores at him gym - love that whole openness thin you got going. I hope anyone one reading may feel my pain of such abuse and disregard. Maybe someone has a relatable story to share. Coming out of this, I hope I find the best damn woman from Woodbridge who can take me as I am and I can take her as she is from the get-go! \n\nLL, go get well.\n\n(I'm mulatto, ladies! In my thirties! They call me handsome!)\n    "

You're a low key actor that isn't totally recognizable except for your niche films. The general public doesn't really know you as well so you can walk into a mall and not get recognized. \n\nWhen I was working at TIFF 2015 you were about to step into a press conference and you looked my way and smiled because I was staring at you like an insane person and I immediately looked down and pretended to scroll through my phone. Today, I was in line to pay for all the clothes I didn't need and I looked up and you were walking up the fucking stairs and we both look at each other. I'm the guy with the fake blonde hair and was wearing sunglasses indoors because I'm part douche, and part blinded by florescent light. Of course, I'm a total pussy and didn't say shit. No one bothered you while you were browsing and I had plenty opportunity just to say hi and then bye and then leave you the fuck alone. You are built like a fucking warrior, by the way. It's a little unnerving but mostly hott as fuck. \n\nI don't know why I'm writing on here.

I want to.   Its just that. - Dory\n\nIts just what? - Theodor\n\nDory was getting up. \"Let me show you,\" Dory said with a tear running down and into her hair.  She had a cunning smile concealing some painful worry.  He was sad.  It hadn't occured to either that they has just met a day or more before.  It didn't matter.\n\nAs they walked through the plains orange and aglow, it grew more silent.  For all their walking nothing seemed to have tired them.  Then, newspapers covered the sky and Theodor was standing in a factory.  Where there should have been a wall, there was an opening to another place.  Some thing stopped him as he yelled out her name and chased after her.  She could not hear him.  Her every step was deafening as her steps echoed through eternity.\n\nHe fell to the gutter and she pulled him back up.  \"Are you okay?\" she asked.  Her eyes were shooting transparently with all of her soul as she offered him her umbrella.  \"Thank you,\" he said and the rain stopped.  \"How was it in the Bahamas?\" he asked.  Then she met him in an infernal stare that would terrify even the most terrifying of creatures.  She took a step forward and unlocked the car [beep].\n\nDay 5\n\n\"I guess we'll be travelling in this one,\" said Dory.  With the passing of that storm she pulled up the hood of the car and checked the oil level.  Everything was good.\n\nThey stayed in that car for an age of yore.  Many winters passed and many summers without a word to each other.\n\nUntil one day the sun came to set on the past.\n\nDory was sitting at a cafe on her break where he had just strolled in pushing a baby carriage.  \n\n\"Excuse me, but have I met you before?\" he asked wondering if he had ever seen her or was it a trick his mind was playing on him.\n\n\"She didn't answer.\" Dory said.\n\n\"Hi,\" Theodor said.\n\n\"I didn't say hi,\" said Dory.\n\n\"Listen, I'm here.  I found this kid on the beach.  What was I to do.  Leave it?  I can't,\" he was saying in an angry voice.\n\n\"I think you have me confused faith someone else.\" Dory started to cry.\n\n\"Its our baby.\" Theodor\n\n\"I know.  I can't keep running like this.  Its worse everytime.  Just stay here this time, please.\"\n\n\"Everything keeps changing all the time.  I'll come back for you.  I have to hide the baby.\" Theodor said as her hair fell forward covering her tears.\n\n\"I'll be right back.\"\n\nHe comes back. She waited.  They go together to get baby.  No ones a zombie.  Not yet.\n\n\"I'm getting hungry,\" said the store manager.  [Bang] A sniper got him.\n\nDay 6\n\n\"Bartender, two shots of whatever is on the house,\" Theodor said.\n\n\"Listen here, nothing is on the house.  I'll get y'all some water, but that's it,\" said the bartender.  \"This is a robbery, all of your watches and valuables!\" Dory was serious.  With the baby in the stroller no one could have suspected them of this plot.\n\nYes, it was a plot of plots to be reckoned with.\n\nDay 7\n\nDory was standing at the far end of the ground floor.  Mozart was playing in a room from an out of tune transistor radio.\n\nHe walked to her.  Ages passed and time passed.  He was walking to her.  She was standing at the elevator.  Then, the question remains.  Where did everyone go?  It didn't matter.  \n\nWas it day or night?  It was always the same outside.  Finally, day breaks.\n\nThe zombies were shooting each other.  It all ended and began at the same Tim. What was one thing became another in a turn of a minute.  What seemed to be was and wasn't and what wasn't certainly was.  Yet, in all the commotion, nothing happened to the baby.  One thing that was a certainty.\n\nDay 8\n\"Are you injured?\"\n\n\"We're okay,\" they said in unison.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\nThey said nothing.\n\nThen, the world went black and day light returned, but the .

    "details": "\nThe zombies were gone.  At least that iz what they told us on CNO.  Reports were coming in about a necrotized AIDS virus.  The press said it was just starting to learn that they had unconfirmed reports of a project investigating dementia gone awry in a facility for dementia.  Apparently, the nerual-dwelling bacteria did not necrotize tissue postmortem, but instead lead to organ support.\n\nReports were also coming in of babies being born to zombie women.  The babies were alive and human, albeit with a unique bacterial flora.\n\nWe were waiting for confirmation from central command that it was safe to exit the safe zones. \n\nWe were walking through the designated recreation area when a gun shot went off.  Another suicide I guessed.  They were ever more frequent as the undead were being identified. \n\nDory, why don't you, with all that fire power, go into the house and see what is going on.  -Theodor\n\nVery well. -Dory\n\nI'll be here when you come back. -Theodor\n\nAlas, Dory came back, but Dory had changed.\n\nTheodor, I want to leave. -Dory\n\nWe haven't received word from the news, yet.  Besides, Captain Yvete is guarding at the gate. -Theodor\n\nYou don't understand, Theodor, I didn't bring anything to defend myself.  I thought I could instead of shooting, just talk to it. -Dory\n\nI should have gone instead of you. -Theodor\n\nAnd leave me alone without you? -Dory\n\nDay 1\n\nDory was standing on the escalator.  Oh what woe it is to be in the spring air.  Aloof and about.  There it was the chiming of the train as the passengers disembarked.  One of them pale, sickly, and approaching her with something about a shadows reach.\n\nHurry! -Dory\n\nTheodor and Dory start running.  Where are we running? -Dory\nYou said to hurry.  We're going to the vault. -Theodor\n\nWhy there?-Dory\nIts the only safe place around.-Theodor\nBy then the police had already taken over it and were shooting everyone in sight.  No safe passage nor refuge for anyone.\n\nWe have to get on a boat and leave.-Theodor\nTeddy! -Dory\nDory!-Theodor\nThe two ran and ran and eventually got on a rowboat.  \nTeddy, where are we going?-Dory\nSomewhere I don't know where. We just have to stay together. -Theodor\nWe need to let our families know we are running away. -Dory\nTrust me Dory, they are beyond the horizon.  We must go towards the darkness lest we die or worse. -Theodor\nNo, I won't have any of this nonsense.  You don't mean it. -Dory\nYou will see once we get there. -Theodor\nArghhh! How could you do this to me! [More screaming and slapping]. I love you. [Crying]. - Dory\nThe two exchange looks and with determination for a new life, continue rowing over the freezing cold water, the city behind them burning. Planes overhead were darting every which way. \n\n[Bang bang bang] Identify yourselves. -Coast Guard\n\nThe row boat was starting to sink.\nThat instant the second in command, neutralized his commanding officer.\n\nThe order has come to evacuate north!  Are you wounded?!? - Soldier\n\nWe are not wounded! - Dory\n\nWe are not sick! -Theodor\n\nSoldier, help us! - Dory\n\nThe two boarded the boat.\n\nPlease make yourselves at home, we have to take to the chopper at 1400. -Soldier\n\nWhat? -Theodor\n\nRelax, you can handle a 50 calibre machine gun can't you? I'll be right back. -Soldier\n\nI'm going to have to kill him thought Theodor.\n\nDory was playing with her hair in the mirror.\n\nHey dude! What's your name? -Dory\n\n[Bang bang bang] \nTheodor shot the unnamed soldier.\n\nWell that's great because there was only one bullet left.\n\nUnfortunately there was no warning sticker for the red button.  The automated governance system was activated.  Who would have known that the Commander was being housed on this dingy vessel anyway.  The earth trembled.  The air was glowing dawn red in the west and plum neon in the sky above.  It was as though the world had become a cage.\n\nThey found the Chopper in good condition and within a few tries had it flying.  It was in the air.  They were taking it south to the capitol. \n\nMr. President, Theodor and I have captured the Commander.  Mr. President?\n\nDoes not.  Initiate hide and seek protocol. Abort abort- Mr. President\n\nTheodor, are you seeing this? -Dory\n\nWell, I hear that....\n\nI just saved a bunch of zombies by [womp womp womp]. - Dory\n\nDay 3\n\nIt was a disco party.  Everyone was dancing.  The pope was handing out franklins and the aristocracy was sipping goose.  The fact that it was raining did not stop the festivities.  There were orgies everywhere.  Some of them, bloodier than others. No one seemed to care.\n\nThe world ending was just the beginning of yet another cycle of the changing tide.  There was an Easter bunny adorned man on a trampoline throwing painted eggs at the Eastern delegation.  Ships from all over were docking and the water was sweet and pink.\n\nDJ Jay was playing as the fog machine unleashed spores all over.\n\nJesus, what are you doing here? -Dory\n\nHey man, congrats on making it out of witness protection.  -Passerby\n\nYeah, I was getting tired of selling weed anyway. -Jesus\n\nYeah, sorry about what happened back at the trial.  - Theodor\n\nAnyway, when are we going to get to see your Dad?\n\nNow. -Jesus\n\n    "

    "title": "Zombies",
    "details": "\nIt starts off in the concrete parking lot of a movie theatre.  Three friends were on their way out when military convoys started arriving.  Men were shouting.  Soldiers were shooting.  Women screaming.  Children were being executed.  All of the school buses were set on fire.  \"Anyone who resists will be thrown over to the enemy!\"  \n\n\"I beg of you have mercy upon m...\" cried a woman.  More screaming and shouting.  Then, came the horde.  A massive cry of the undead. The children had arisen.  The soldiers died.  The men picked up the weapons and started firing upon the children.  Then, the women started getting attacked as the children overwhlemed them. \n\nAlas, all of them were dead.\n\nEveryone dies in the end.\n\nFinally, when they were all zombies.  The zombies came to form a homeland.  They took over NASA and created speed of light travel.  Within the next century they had colonized all of the Universe and even found God's homeplanet.  It was inhabited with mutant strippers.\n\nA great war ensued whereupon the president of the zombies kills God and in doing so destroys the fabric of spacetime, making this universe non-existant.\n\nThis sparked a domino effect.  One-by-one the universes collapsed.  Fortunately, the one universe where Jesus returns in the year 2000 was still okay.  However, by then Craigslist was banned and all life was on a flat Earth.\n\nThat day, Aliceson walked east until she fell off.  The best of our sources have affirmed that she is still floating in space, searching, for new hope.\n\nThat year, I started the new hop project.  A team of the best minds on this side of Earth started looking for a way to dig a tunnel out of this side of the Earth and onto the other side.\n\nWe succeeded.  There was nothing there.  It was a bunch of rocks in the dark.\n\nJesus was not pleased with our work and decided that it would be best that Aliceson become the new God.  He searched out Alice and asked her to lead her people to the promised universe.\n\nWhen they got there, using zombie light speed technology they landed back in a world of volcanoes and rubble, restarting the evolution of man in the time of dinosaurs was disastrous and now there are tyrannosauruses in space suits looking for a place to get a triceratops burger.\n\nThe zombie virus resurfaced in the race of dinosaur-human hybrids and they are a very peaceful sort.  They reproduce through spores and it is not yet clear what any of this has to do with anything.\n\nThe three of them left the movie theatre together.  The night was hushed down.  The air was humid.  It was just another Tuesday night.  One of them offered to call a cab.  The other two protested.  That is when he came.  Nothing more sinister than a cab driver filling up at the gas station.  That's when things got weird.  At the gas station the shop keeper ran out screaming.  We ran back into the theatre only to find it was empty.  Then the lights went out and then the men arrived.  Fully armed and shooting lasers through the walls. \nThey're breaking through!- Screened one of them.  Get the prisoners and use them now! That's an order soldier!\nDroves of the undead fell upon defenseless men, women, and children while we just watched from a distance.  We have to do something!- Said the one who had the cell phone.\nHe called the police, parents, and friends.  No one answered.  Day break set in and the sky was snubbed out with smoke.\n\nDay 1\nI don't know what just happened-Steffie said. \nThis can't be real. It has to be a joke.- said Ryan.\nYou saw those bodies!  Are you saying we saw it and it was not real!  Aliceson said.\nStiffie was sure that all they had to do was sit tight and things would be okay.  The rest of the world was another mile away. \nSooner or later there was bound to be a reconnaissance team or something. \nDay 2\nWith no hope of the darkness lifting and hunger setting in, Ryan offered to sacrifice himself and run into the KFC and commandeer some dinner.  He went across the parking lot.  Darting in and out of sight between cars.  All of a sudden there was screaming and then nothing.\nStiffie and Aliceson were working on getting a van started and just as the ignition switch started, Ryan came carrying something.  He was covered in blood.  In his arms, the beaten body of a child.\nListen guys said Ryan-this is all there was on the menu.\nDay 3\nWith the headphones on and the cinema door open, they finally decided to give today a shot.  During the night an old man walked in and fell asleep in the aisle of the theatre.  He was wearing full trekking gear and had a hummer.  We couldn't let him see our leftovers from the night before.  Breakfast was quick.\nAt day break we woke him up.  He explained that he was here on vacation and that he didn't understand why the army ad just blown up all the suburbs.  We were devastated and happy.  Devastated since we wouldn't ever see our friends and happy that we were not discovered in the onslaught.\nWait a sec.-Ryan\nWhat is it, dear? - Said Jim, the theatre tourist.\nIf what you're saying is true that means everyone is dead, right? -Steffie.\nDude, you remember that movie with the zombies.  What if this is like that.  No, its nothing like that.  Just saying it would be cool if it was. -Ryan said.\nAlliceson, you're the only female here possibly in the world.  Its your call.  Do we stay or go?  -Tourist\nWe go- Aliceson\nThey got into the hummer.  The car was loaded with fuel, food and water.\nDay 4.  The alligator alley highway was packed with cars parked.  They stopped.  They got out of the car.  Then, they made their way on foot on to port sheiza air force base.\nGuys there's no one there!  Everything's great but what the hell?!?!- Tourist\nOh, right. -Aliceson.\nWhen will we take a break.  My head hurts.  -Ryan.\nOh my god! Peter!  -Aliceson\nAliceson, there's no one over there can't you... Argh! -Steffie\nWhy?!?!?!? Stiffie! Nooooooooo. -Aliceson.\nHello Aliceson. -Peter\nPeter, I thought you moved to California.  No, Aliceson, I am sorry.\nYou bastard!  -Ryan\nPlease relax. - Peter\nRelax?! - Tourist\nYou have some explaining to do. - Aliceson\nWho is that over there? -Ryan\nWho that? I don't know who that is!-Peter\nAhhhhhh!  What's he doing?!?!!!! Oh my god is he?! - Aliceson\nHe's just sick I swear.  Now, papa I know his you like company so I brought over some friends from school for dinner! - Peter\nNo way!   -  Tourist\nWow, he really wrestled down an alligator. - Ryan\nLet's just get on with finding another car up ahead where the highway traffic jam clears up.  -Aliceson.\nFinally in Fort shizzoma the group of five entered a ghost town.  Devoid of human life.  They found a nice stilted mansion.\nDay 5\nSunset\nRyan was sitting on the rooftop waiting to jump when Aliceson approached him in a silk dress. \nYou know, Ryan, this wouldn't be the first time I've been.. You know...-Aliceson\nSniffle. - Ryan\nYes, I am aware.  Want some candy coated bonbons? -Aliceson\nBut I thought we ate them at the movies. -Ryan\nI've been saving mine for you.  -Aliceson\nI can't. -Ryan\nWhy? -Aliceson\nListen I just c-Ryan\nReally -Aliceson\nShe stopped his words and they had a cup of tea.\nDay 6\nMy dear boy, would you help a poorvold man. -auditory hallucination. \nI have to help him out thought the old man.  Wait that's me, Ryan where are you?!?!? -Second auditory hallucination.\n~You are mine.  You are mine love.  You are mine! Clear away through the aether my life.~\nEntering upon that blasted cassete ophone the five broke into an abandoned adult entertainment store.\nOh the filth! - Aliceson said\nAaaa Aaaa Aaaaaaa! - movie on wall-mounted TV.\nGuys what are we looking for? -tourist\nYou got a problem?  What about you, Peter? Fucking faggot! -Ryan\nNot that you should care, but I just don't feel good being here. -Peter\nI think I know something that might make you feel more comfortable, Peter. -Aliceson\nAliceson, what? -Ryan\nPeter, come with me to that viewing booth. -Aliceson\nOkay, I think we have a few minutes.  -Peter\nPeter, put your pants back on.  Its about your father.  He's always trying to make out with me.  He gets close and tries to bite me and I push him away but he keeps coming back.  Could you please talk to him? -Aliceson\nSure, look I'm sorry about what happened to Steffie.  I know she was close to you.  - Peter\nDon't let Ryan push you around like that- Aliceson.\nThat's when they all decided it was time to leave.  It was late and the entire lot of them were ready to leave for another safe haven.\n\nDay 7\n\nRyan, how you doing big guy? -Philip\n\nPhilip, do I know you? - Ryan\n\nHow else would you know my name?! Besides, what is your problem.  You keep looking at me. - Philip\n\nYou just woke me up.  Why would I not be looking at you? - Ryan\n\nAliceson is furious.  Ryan what is it with you?!  - Aliceson\n\nNothing, what's the matter with you? -Ryan\n\nListen you two, I have had a really freaky time getting here.  I don't even know how this happened.  No one is even around. -Philip\n\nYeah, and what is the deal with only one girl here? -Aliceson\n\nYou weren't complaining last night, Aliceson.  Isn't that right? -Philip\n\nAly, you know this guy? - Ryan\n\nI thought we were special, babe. It's just that Philip has something you don't and I can't be with someone that is sleeping with girls like Rachel anymore. - Aliceson\n\nAll, you had to do is tell me that you don't love me anymore and I would have left.  Now, you have to berate me in front of everyone.  That's how it has to be.  Then, then then. Ryan died.\n\nRachel and Kimberly arrived in the wee hours of the morning.  They have a car and an apartment on the outskirts of town on  the bay.  Yesterday they were told to drive south east, but thought it was sinister.  They made it to the midway gathering point on the Junction.\n\nThey brought one head of cattle to pull their supereconomy rental car.\n\n\"We have to be quick.\"\n\nDay 8\n\nTo be continued...    "

I thought you were into me too so wasn't sure what was going on when you tried to skip out with your friend, I think you girls were waiting for a ride or a cab when I came out and approached you, I asked for your phone number you giggled and kicked me right in the nuts! By the time I could get up you girls had disappeared.\n\nI know this might sound weird but when you kicked me in the balls I actually liked it? Like I said it might sound a bit odd but wondering if you would ever consider meeting up downtown and booting me in my nuts again, I'll spread em wide this time and let you smash my sack! You could get out some of the built up aggression you so obviously have and I can explore this strange new fetish?  If you see this send me your name, pic and where we were when you left me curled up on the sidewalk.    "

You were wearing a very unique t-shirt (which I commented on), and you were waiting for someone (who hadn't shown up yet), and I was fleeing from someone (already at the bar) and found sanctuary at your table. I was with my girl friend who remained seated at the bar while I was talking to you. I would love to find out what happened after I left and just talk to you some more. I think you're a really special person and wanted you to know that.\n\nIf you or someone who knows a Chris with a last name that begins with a \"C\" (I don't want to post it for reasons of privacy) who was at The Only Saturday night of the long weekend (July 30th), please pass this along or contact me - I'd really appreciate it.

I take full responsibility for my actions. But hey,  at least you got something out of it - a brand new fetish. \n\nTo be fair, you didn't ask for my number in the most respectable manner. You grabbed my ass and you whispered rape in my ear and then licked my neck. I'm sorry but that is creepy as fuck. I was legitimately afraid of you. You came on a little too strong and I got spooked. You see, women are like those big industrial photocopiers at offices - you need to take each step slowly and be very patient. You can't just jam 100 pages in the scanner of a document that hasn't been open in twenty years and expect the machine to take it all in. \n\nYou need to dial that shit down. \n\nYour newly discovered fetish actually reminded me of Rousseau. I just learned that he loved getting spanked by women that reminded him of his mother. He wrote books about it apparently. So yeah, I don't think you're all that weird. Are you a lawyer by any chance? Lawyers get their balls kicked all the time; that might be a thing for you. \n\nAnd yeah I don't remember that night all that well so I can't give more details about our encounter. I just remember you doing those creepy things. I remember your eyes. They had this insanity in them. Like the kind you find when you look at photos of Hunter S. Thompson, William S. Burroughs and my personal favourite, Jean Paul Sartre. Dude looks cray. Google him. It will make you laugh. \n\nAnyway, sorry again about the nut kicking but I was just defending myself.

    "details": "\nIt's hard to swallow knowing that the woman you love with all your heart and soul, the woman who's face you see in every other woman, the woman you wake up/fall asleep thinking of, the woman who still makes your heart race 5 years later doesn't feel the same way about you. Realizing that you aren't constantly running across her mind like she is in yours, is a difficult thing to grasp. It makes it all more difficult when she says she still loves you. \n\nYou give your all to someone hoping that they'll stay forever, but sometimes hope isn't enough, I guess.\nShe will grow bored of you, she will look elsewhere for a release of excitement, she will suggest taking breaks...yet, you will still forgive and forget, albeit, over and over all in the name of love. When she's vulnerable, you naturally love her more than you ever have as if she was your own child. You will caress her cheeks gently and run your fingers through her hair as she leans against your shoulder. When she's guarded and secure, you will respect her mind and commend her for being a bold woman. You will talk proudly of her, you will encourage her to keep pushing through this thing called life. When she's confused and anxious about everything from careers, finances, daily errands, and even about yourself, you choose to stay by her side and support her with compassion and endearing words vowing to never leave her. When she's lonely, sick, or bored, you will surprise her at work, surprise her with gifts, you will call her to make sure she is loved and wanted, you will massage her void of any sexual advances simply because you want her to be relaxed, and ultimately, you will do everything you possibly can to love her. \n\nYou put aside your own desires for the sake of making this one person 'happy'. You pick up after their every mistake and tell yourself that it'll all be worth it in the end when both of our lives are set. Yet, they won't feel the same - for there is something greater, something more worthy than you 'out there'. She can still be the only girl you've ever kissed and been with, and it won't matter in the end. You ignore every woman making moves at you not because you are loyal, but that you just see every other woman from a gender neutral lens. You only crave one person. You lust for their touch. You yearn for their breath on your neck. You desire their warmth when you are alone. You find yourself the loneliest when you think about how you love someone so much yet you don't feel it reciprocating. You're told every single day that you aren't smart enough, you aren't innovative enough, that you don't have enough money, even though we're the same age going through the same problems. At the same time, I have more money saved than anyone I know in my age group. At the same time I look after my family 24/7. At the same time I stay up until 3am looking for a suitable position on Bay Street. At the same time I'm putting my blood sweat and tears into this one woman. If that's not hard working or an all encompassing person, then what is. \nIt's a cliche but they're constantly looking elsewhere to find answers to their insecurities and fears, yet the one who will take a bullet for them is standing right behind them with a bouquet of roses. \n\nDespite what I just said, I love you with everything in me. Even when we are taking this 'break' or whatever you want to call it, I still can't look at other women. All I think about is you. It's always been you, and it's sad to say, but it will always be like that. I always want to see your face. I always want to give you my input on which dress to buy or which outfit will look good put together. I always want to feed you. I always want to randomly massage your thighs and shoulders. I always want to hold your hands. I always want to write you letters on the 6th of every month (p.s. happy monthly anniversary). I always want to clean your mouth after you've had lunch. I always want to kiss your hands like a queen when we say goodnight. I always want to take you to new restaurants. I want to always go on trips with you. I always want to hear about your day. I always genuinely want to hear about your problems and give you my love and support... I just always want to be there for you. \n\nAt the end of the day, it hurts even more because I know you'll come back and then probably take another break from me. I can't keep being treated like this, it's taken its toll on me mentally and physically. I just want to know whether you actually want me in your life further on. If not, I don't want to keep hoping, I'd rather be alone.\n\np.s. I bought you those floor seat tix to the concert you always wanted to go to. I'm too much of a coward to message you because I'm afraid you're with someone else again, which is why I say everything here. \n    "

    "details": "\nI needed to respond to all you amazing guys who have replied to a post of mine!\n\nI really can't tell you how inspired I am right now. \n\nI'm ready to tell this guy I drool over and get instantly aroused by.......that maybe we should hook up sometime? Just his smell alone makes me itch for him. I'm super scared to mention anything to him because I do fear rejection and I don't want to ruin the friendship we have. \n\nYes, I am very flirty when he is around but not to the point of obvious because I do have a partner (at this point the wrong partner) who is always with me when we are around him. Plus our other friends are there as well. We are never alone together.....except when we meet outside the bathroom......and at that point all I want to do is just grab him and drag him back in bathroom with me.\n\nAnd there the fantasy would start......without a word I'd put my hand on his crotch.....finding it rock hard and ready for my drippy wet slider. \n\nQuietly with my fingers to his lips.......I'd unzip him......releasing his phallus to the warmth of my hand. Hopefully he'd crack a slight smile then lean back against the wall, closing his eyes. \n\nI'd know then he'd want me to stroke it slow at first......then with a little more vigor.....stroking it as hard as it could possibly get. I'd then feel the need to slide down him as to face its girth. I'd spit on it......just to lick it off the tip. Grabbing the back of my head.....he'd press my face forward making me take it all in....all the way down to the back of my throat, as his hair tickled my nose. \n\nI would be so excited and crazy hot by this point just having his manhood gagging my throat.......I couldn't resist feeling my own wetness dripping with a finger or two. Moaning quietly we'd stare at each other with this new sensual passion.\n\nLooking down at me, his moan ever so quiet would turn to a masculine grunt. Then and only then.....I'd know he's ready from me. Ready for me to hop up on the sink and slide my panties to the side while he spread my very soft legs wide. \n\nHim leaning forward and me against the mirror, my hand reaches for my clit......I'd wet a few fingers by rubbing my juices around my c*nt. Knowing I'm watching him, he presses against me, pulling me forward and directing his stiff head towards my pussy. \n\nWith one hand he grips my leg holding it slightly up and with the other he finds my clit spreading my juices up and down his shaft......getting me all slippery. Sloppy enough to rub his tip up and down my wetness until my sticky hole sucked it in.\n\nAgain I'd have to cover his mouth from admitting the sounds of pleasures. With his head tilted back, c*ck deep within......hands holding back my legs......we'd f*ck......quietly and quickly ensuring maximum pleasure. \n\nAs I watch his smooth phallus pop out, then in, of my sloppy wet hole......I'd push back on his chest and continue to rub my clit......then grabbing for his c*ck......squeezing it as it slides in and out of my warm juices. Stroke after stroke, slide after slide, with our breath laboured, we'd edge closer to that mind blowing release. \n\nWithout a sound and our eyes wide open we become stuck to one another. As the climax comes closer the sound of slurping more defined ........we'd see the end in each others eyes. \n\nFeeling overwhelmed by excitement it comes......the walls of my c*nt starts to clamp down hard on his c*ck. Squeeze after squeeze, slide in after slide out, my c*nt throbs with an explosion of wet cum. \n\nRight then with a another grunt he shoots deep inside me, shaking it off as he slumps forward, quietly moaning in my ear. He's relieved.\n\nI wipe the sweat from his forehead as he grabs some toilet paper. Slowly he pulls out, wiping me and him clean. Then with a quick lick to taste our pleasure and a sweet kiss to sharing it, we'd dress quickly so we can return to our friends, completely serviced and mellow! \n\nI have this overwhelming obsession to be erotically pleased by him and in turn reciprocate the sensual experience.......but not a need to ruin our lives.......so you see I'm stuck but wanting so bad! The next time we see each other I'll remember what you have all said to me and go for it! Or maybe not?\n\nAll I know is I need a bath.....lol!\n\nCheers guys,\nWetnesss    "

It was ghetto AF but you protected me. It didn't matter where we were. We had each other. We met a few times after that. I even came to watch one of your football games when the Niagara  spears came to Brampton. Remember us on the blow up mattress that had a whole in it? Lol. \nI snuck you into my room. Hid you in the closet and brought us food. \nI think about you still. 10 years later. I remember our last conversation. I should have never been so rude. I should have chosen you.  \n\nI would love to catch up.

You were wearing a very unique t-shirt (which I commented on), and you were waiting for someone (who hadn't shown up yet), and I was fleeing from someone (already at the bar) and found sanctuary at your table.  I was with my girl friend who remained seated at the bar while I was talking to you.  I would love to find out what happened after I left and just talk to you some more.  I think you're a really special person and wanted you to know that.\n\nIf you or someone who knows a Chris with a last name that begins with a \"C\" (I don't want to post it for reasons of privacy) who was at The Only on July 30th (which was a Saturday night), please either pass this along to him or contact me - I'd really appreciate it.

Lost in the labyrinth of her own creation, dependent upon pillars atrophied by time. Two hearts torn, through no fault of their own, into lesser parts and base desires.\n\nThat evening, he couldn't get her off his mind. Gears turning, as a constant racing through the empty corridors of his mind. Consumed. \n\nHe wore the same thing he wore everyday. Checked his tattooed hands for empty spots and stains of tar. He would be ready for any eventuality, as previous involvement had taught him. It was never too soon, and the very thought made his heart race and mind wander.\n\nHe noticed her first. A crooked smile parted his lips. Enthusiastic. Radiant. Captivated. Hers, at least for tonight.\n\nConversation led to closeness. Closeness to contact. Contact to privacy. Privacy to tenderness. \n\nHe stripped her with the vigor of youth, guided by experience. Entwined, the stroking of hands, lips, and tongue, playing her form like a puppet. Slowly building and finally allowing release, in mutual ecstasy. His. Hers. Delivered in unison.\n\nIf he were to remain but a memory, it would be one she never forgot.\n\n(Disclaimer: I am not your intended recipient, this is just an exercise.)    "

I woke up in tears this morning with a desperate need to tell you I love you.... But I can't... I can't face hearing the cold hard truth from your lips... That you are no longer in love with me... Even after all this time I need to maintain the fantasy that one day we might yet get back together... I can't face the truth that you don't want me anymore, just the thought of that makes my actual physical heart pain, and my body and arms ache terribly even though you shut me out of your life and heart so long ago... So I run and hide from the truth and don't tell you that I'm dying without you, and that nothing and no one can replace you... I run away... And have lost you forever...\n\nThis is why I avoid going to a movie with you or going to dinner with you, because even though you seem to agree to do those things with me as friends, I know I'll just ruin the evening by breaking down into tears, telling you I'm still in love with you, and you'll respond with the cold hard truth that I can't face.... So I avoid even just seeing you socially even though I'm desperate to see you...\n\nI don't know what to do.  Im moving to Waterloo in Jan.... Transferd to an office there.  I don't know how to get over the fear of talking to you.... I know you resent me and have moved on... You have been in and out if anothers love.... For all I know you're in love with him still... But I still want another chance with you.  I want to give you the love you deserve.... Maybe I'll tell you after I complete the move to Waterloo in Jan..... But evey single day without you I ache for you... I want you so bad in so many different ways.\n\nBut... part of thinks, with tears, I need to face the cold hard truth that I lost my chance with you, that you don't love me anymore, that you're happier being with other guys, and that I need to learn how to move on and let go like you did.... I don't know how you did it, but I'm happy for you that you did, in a way, because at least I know you're no longer hurting this way.\n\nI still love you and I still am in love with you... I don't know how to stop... And even with the news you told me recently, I still want to be with you... So it must be love right?\n\nI know you're fed up with what you thought were empty promises so I'm not going to mention to you if we communicate that I'm moving to Waterloo until the move is complete and I'm there... My hope is you'll be with me again one day....\n\nBut if I have lost you forever, please always remember this... If you're ever in a place where you're wondering if anybody in the world really cares about you or really loves you, know this; there is.  I do, and no matter what always will lovely lady.\n\nC.    "

Even if it was good, bad or indifferent. \n\nFor those who do write about a missed connection, don't you wish you had taken advantage of that opportunity and somehow made a connection and exchanged phone numbers? Do you now make more of an effort to make connections instead of having missed connections?\n\nAlthough the Celestine Prophecy was fictional but I found some of the \"insights\", for lack of a better word, insightful! Coincidences are not accidents. It's life giving you hints - that the person who caught your attention may, knowingly or unknowingly, have information for you or has a reason for catching your attention at that moment in time. It's certainly an interesting thought. Since reading the book I have gone up to complete strangers to tell them they remind me of someone I know. In most instances, the encounters were interesting to say the least and some were actually helpful. \n\nHopeful Romantic\n\nUpdate: Thank you to the many people who did reply and shared their missed connection stories. Some had happy endings, some were short lived and fizzled out and some sadly did not work out.  Some replied to me to say that they also wrote on and checked the missed connection section at some interval. But all respondanta had the hope and courage I certainly envy! 😍    "

I feel calm and happy. \n\nAs I said the last time.....I'm so sorry about everything. It's so important to get this off my chest and to tell u how much I loved u deeply and it really wasn't either of our faults that I got PT..\n\nIf I was a pussy....I would have left my mom and ran out of the room and not stood by her side as she died. Instead I stood strong as I was taught and kept my integrity as a real man and worried about paying for it later. Man did I pay for it....lolol\n\nWith u....slowly after that, I couldn't love anymore..... I'm so so sorry. \n\nI didn't mean to be so cold. I was so very hurt. I wish u had the strength to had have grabbed me, hugged me and said k... Wake the fuck out of this funk. It's ok, I know u didn't have the strength or knowledge to help me. Doesn't matter now. I beat it. 👌🏻😘\n\nIt did matter so much at the time, but I woke up waaaaay too late. (about a year ago or so.)\nToo bad for both of us. As I'm not to sure how much experience u have gained but once upon a time we had a deep passionate love. I still miss that a little bit. I don't miss always trying so hard to chear u up on the wk ends. U kept thinking ur life was so hard and were so negative. When I looked at ur life I knew u had more strength than u were exhibiting. I did....eventually lolol. Better late then never I guess for both of us. \n\nI hope u are happy. If u haven't faced ur shit than I know u can only be so happy. If u haven't yet I know u will one day. \n\nI hope u have not gained a bunch of weight and that u have been taking care of yourself. Thankfully I'm back to my old self in that way.....powerful and muscular. Sometimes a different thought about our passion we once had crosses my mind as I'm sure u remember how I felt when I'm in good shape. 😁 Lolol\n\nI'll always miss u as a long lost love in the far distance that almost doesn't even seem like it really happened anymore. We both got pretty crazy in the end and kept trying to see who could hurt each other worse...lolol very stupid and immature on both our parts obviously.\n\nI was gonna stop there, but I won't.....lol.\n\nListening to SUN ELECTRIC in the background with my headphones with big pup by my side.  The name of the album u heard frequently and kinda liked a few of the tracks as u mentioned is called -kitchens\n\nNot sure if u care. It's certainly conducive to opening anyone's heart and or mind if u can get past how strange and unconformist it is. \n\nSome of it reminds me of u. Some of it reminds me of after finishing djing years ago and chillin after my set. \n\nI keep wanting to reiterate how sorry I am. I should have held ur heart so very softly in my hands instead of pushing u away. Probably was one of the top 3 hardest times in my life. Therefore loving u became secondary unfortunately. \n\nPup is doing good, she loves our walks and plays with many neighbourhood kids. Still doesn't like dogs too much lolol. It's coming along slowly with gentle training. I can't imagine if we bumped into each other one day by the lake or something. Obviously I'm gonna avoid that like the plague at least for a few years anyway. However, I'm sure she would wine and cry out for u with deep love as I still try to never mention ur name cause I think it hurts her feelings. As to her.....she didn't do anything wrong to u to be hung out to dry from ur love towards her. Neither did B by the way. Certain people in my life thought that was really weird of u as they did nothing to deserve ur treatment of them. I tried to defend u cause I didn't want anyone....or myself to think that u were just a bad person. \n\nConsidering how ur parents were so cold with u sometimes I guess I can understand how u could be like that. My mom had many problems but could never be as cold as u were treated by them. \n\n I'll always still love u....I'll even love the big C in some ways forever. Lolol. I'm sure that's hard to understand. It is for me too, I guess I just can't hate anyone that I once loved. \n\nHaven't seen B since September 2014. I'm sure u can imagine how that feels for him and me. I speak to him on the phone. She has complete control and has lost her mind, gained even more weight and won't let me see him. He was almost crying on the phone on Father's Day as he was trying to u understand why he can't see me. I'm very close to having the courts make her but it's taken sooooo long. \n\nUhhhh.....u probably won't even see this...lololol\n\nIf u do, I know u. I'm sure u care less than I do. That's ok. Once upon a time u were focused, excitable, loving, passionate and in great shape. Those were the best times I will always remember. \n\nDo us both a favour and don't hold a grudge. It's not healthy.\n\nU can if u wish obviously but I'm way past that now. \n\nLuv ya sweetness \n\nTake care. \n\nTranquility \n\n\n    "

You were wearing a beautiful sandal coloured dress with a cute smile.\n\nWe chatted for a bit, you were very cute, polite and friendly, which is very rare in Toronto :D\nWhile we chatted the cab I called stopped near me, and I said have a good night to you, but as the cab moved, I realized I should have offered you to have you dropped off on the way, I didnt offer. \n\nI thought it would be inappropriate, and you are incredibly cute so I thought it might look inappropriate as you might mistake me for offering.\n\nEitherways, I really should have offered you the ride considering how late it is, and on the way there was a crime scene with cop taped all over a block away which is why the street cars were cancelled. \n\nI feel terrible that I didnt offer, not sure how far you were going to have to walk, since the whole area looked deserted and it was unexpected.\nI also noticed you thought I ended the chat abruptly as the cab came stopped near me. \n\nIf you are reading this, drop me a message.

    "title": "Blue haired creature - Riot Fest 2014, Toronto, Rebel stage",
    "details": "\nYou were the first thing I spotted the second I got to the Rebel stage. It was impossible to not notice you. Your hair was shinning boldly under the sun, your enthusiasm was contagious. You spent a lot of time in the moshpit, having the time of your life. After Radkey's set, you came close to the gate to shake their hands. Your attitude was incredible. And your smile. Damn, that smile. It was simply radiant. Same goes for the blue hair dancing on your forehead, right over your mischievous twinkling eyes. I tried paying attention to the bands playing on stage, to the rest of the crowd, my boyfriend next to me... ...but my eyes always came back to you. I was fascinated. Couldn't look away.\n \nYou were alone. The concept of someone going alone to a festival was completely insane for me, at the time. The thought of having to go somewhere unaccompanied used to cripple me. But after seeing you, everytime I started feeling uneasy because of this, you would come to my mind. I remembered how you were having such a blast. Living in the moment. And instantly it made me feel so much better. Serene. Eventually I started going out more. And more. Even travelling in faraway cities, which I never thought I would find the balls to do by myself. I've seen and experienced a lot of wonderful things this past year, things I would have normally declined or ignored because I was too afraid. Didn't take long to realize that I'd much rather tag along a crowd of people that are really having fun than to feel stuck with someone wishing to be somewhere else, complaining. I used to think that only people that nobody liked had to be by themselves. But I doubt that such a charismatic guy like you was there alone because nobody cared about him. Seeing you changed my whole perspective. I stopped being so goddamn judgmental. And my life has been so much easier since.\n \nSpeaking of judgment, I finally dyed my hair purple. I've been dreaming about it for such a long time, rebel colors having fascinated me for years. I thought you looked incredible with your blue hair. So maybe I could look amazing in purple. You've given me the courage to stop caring about what people might think and to just go along with it. And I absolutely love it. I've even had a lot of strangers just walk up to me and tell me they like it. My confidence has increased so much since I've embraced it and I have absolutely no regret about finally taking the plunge.\n \nAnd I've realized that it is much better to try and talk to someone at the risk of looking stupid than not being able to grasp the moment when it came. We didn't talk, that day. I'm sad that I wasn't confident enough to just come up and talk to you. Ask for your name. Tell you how much you made me smile all day. Of course at the time I didn't know how you would eventually leave such a huge positive impact in my life. But I've rarely felt such admiration for a stranger. I should have known that your memory would haunt me once I'd be home. The way I shivered when your arm brushed mine as you were regaining the crowd after bodysurfing. And how you rendered me completely breathless the one time your eyes locked on mine as we passed by.\n \nI wouldn't call this a missed connection. You've given me a lot in the little time that you were in my line of sight, more than most people gave me in my whole life. Maybe you've already opened my eyes to everything I had to learn from you. But I can't help but wonder... ...if you've made my life so much better in just a few hours, how far could you take me?    "

I know I found it hard to show that but that's really how much I loved u. I really could imagine getting old with us both in a rocking chair one day with grand kids running around. How profoundly incredible and beautiful that would have been. \n\nI know that when I started caring about myself less, u did so also. It's ok, I understand that I really didn't give u much reason to love me anymore. For that I will always be sorry. \n\nI know u may be contacted by a Ms. M about the situation. Do what u must. I swear I am not writing u this because of that. \n\nDespite having a 6mnth relationship since we broke up and a few dates with other woman. I LOVE U.\n\nFuck, I'm glad I just spat that out.

Ur love had the ability to calm my intensity and dominance. When u would grab me and calm me down when I wanted to teach someone a lesson when we were out and about and my intensity grabbed me. I will always love that about u. Ur heart and love for me (at one point in Time could calm me instantaneously.) \n\nI love u like the desert creatures love rain. I'll always love u so very deeply. We will probably never lay eyes on each other again, especially because of what u did. It's too bad. We know each other so well we probably could have been great friends. \n\nThe main reason I was thinking of u today is that I had a dream about us last night.....we were on a dance floor, dancing really close and so connected to one another. I held ur head so softly to pull u towards me with a kiss full of passion and fireworks. It felt so good. The smell of ur hair, ur soft dante touch and then grabbing ur hips to pull u in so close that we were one as I kissed u intensely but ever so softly. \n\nI don't think about u as much as I used to but that dream really threw me off today. It reminded me that it's all my fault and I'm so sorry. I just wanted u to know that. If we never see each other again in which we probably won't. I just want u to know that I loved u so very much and it took me so long to wake up from the pt.. That I have only recently realized the incredible love we once had. \n\nI truly wish u the best. I'm sure I will dream of our love on and off forever. As that's how much u meant to me. \n\nFor I can only ask one thing from u????? Please don't be mad at me?

Niether of us were as real as we should've been.The woman that left home, choosing to go west, wasn't anything but a hologram if you will, of the one I fell for.\n\nWhen you said to me, 'You'll pay ' , I knew, as I'm sure you do as well now, that just like the incident in Kenora, I said what I thought was best for 'US' , and if those records hadnt 'Disappeared' that would be very easy to illustrate.This is the only thing I want to say about our past, enough has been said by all.I'm putting this out there, for the gods and the univers, and for you should it find you.\n\nThat woman I fell so completely for, will always have a piece of my heart.That said, unless we literally bump into one another by chance, we shall prolly never speak again.While she has a place in my heart, there is and will never again be, a place in my life for her.We two, are too smart for our own good.Too intelligent, two insecure, and too willing to cause hurt to one another.Whether by words, or my mere presence, I will never again be willing to cause you pain, nor will I allow you to do likewise.I only want , that you find someone that makes you as happy as I once did.I want yoou to feell those butterfiles, and your whole face to light up again; I can still see your eyes shine in my minds eye.If I thought there was even a chance That I could bring that two you, I'd walk through hell and slay many demons for it; we both know that it'll never be though.\n\nBe happy.Find the one that u shine.Put away  the insecurity, i hope you've learned as I have, how wasteful it is.Dont be afraid to live, and to be open. Ive learned to embrace even my short-cominfgs, not to hide them or from them.Your past is a badge of honour, only a wound if you let it be.For the record, it's why I stuck around so long, despite knowing what was happening.Silly things we rationalize, for love.Live and learn.Pleasxe find thatt happiness again, so I know your eyes wuill be shining, and you'll always be smiling.Let go of the negative energy, lest it consume you.Im not trying to minimize anything, on either of our sides, only suggesting that it's better to live for whats ahead, that whats behind.\n\nYou know whats what, and the prices paid already.More to come, I'm sure, for everyone. I've never run from my lessons, or my consequences. I've also never chased anyone, to ensure they meet theirs. That's one thing I'd like not to change; hopefully it wont have to.\n\nI'll always remember you, just the way you were, I try not to think of the other you.I hope you'll try, at least, to do the same.Allow life to happen more, and have faith that everything will work out in i'ts own time.Stop trying to force it, or bend it to your will; in time, theres a price to be paid for such things.I know if you do let go, he will come.I wish you happiness, health and long life, and hopefully one day, I'll be lucky enough to find mine.Please don't attempt contact again, ever.No good can come of it.Perhaps we will meet again, in another life, if and when we are ready to.Til then, our roads go in different directions.Be well girl, I sincerely hope it , always and forever :)\nXOXOXOXOXOXO    "

You're a very driven guy and are teaching yourself programming and helping a friend get his business off the ground.  You like sports (surprise), but are too competitive to play just for fun as you wanna win \"all the ribbons\".  I could tell you are very smart and I found it so lovely that you were so open to talking about your learning disability.  Not sure you noticed but I made sure to slow down the occasional time I had to spell out a name to you so you could catch all the letters in the right order. \n\nSadly I couldn't find a graceful way to ask you out since you were always with your co-workers in a group and I was surrounded by local staff at all times.  Also, I'm a fair bit older than you and that also kept me from thinking you'd be interested.  When you said goodbye yesterday you lingered for a minute and the way you looked at me made me think - maybe just maybe the feeling was mutual and you thought I was interesting too.  I had given you my cell number \"in case you needed something\" at the start of the conference - sadly you never used but I told you if ever you were in town to give me a call and we'd go for drinks - it's high unlikely that will happen but it was a last ditched attempt to let you know i was interested in chatting more.

We had a four train ride ahead and I thought you were really hot so I wanted to sit next to you. To my surprise, you ended up being one the most charming men I've ever met in my entire life. You had such a beautiful way with words and everything you said you made me laugh. You had dreams. You said that you worked as a lawyer and that you were about to become one of the youngest junior partners at your firm. You were on a vacation. You were trainhopping around Easter Europe with your friend Cary. He hated me since day one because you weren't paying any attention to him because of me. I get why he was mad, I would be pissed too if my best friend was ignoring me but you we were just so into each other that nothing else mattered. \n\nAnyway, your dream was to become a pilot but the lessons were apparently way too expensive. Your parents offered to pay for them (even if the meant that they had to take out a second mortgage on their house) but you refused, you wanted to wait until you had enough money saved up so that you could pay for the lessons yourself. You said that they would mean so much more to you that way. You truly realize the value of something once you worked very hard for it. And you know how to work hard. Look how far you've come, Mr. Fancy pants studying at the best law program in the country AND doing a masters on top of that. You set very high goals for your self. I always admired that about you. \n\nAnyway, once the train stopped you and I were relunctant to part ways. We took the same metro car together and you paid for my ticket because I didn't have any forints. The ticket was 300 forints and I freaked out. I said no no no no no no no that's too much. You looked at me and said: calm down, it's only a dollar or something. I did and we went to the car together, riding to who knows where. I didn;t even bother to check where my hostel was. I had no idea where I was going, I was that enchanted by you. \n\nWe said good bye at the train station. I thanked you for the metro ticket and you wished me luck on getting back to my hostel. We added each other on facebook, even though we would probably never speak again and then we parted ways. Of course I got lost. The streets were dark and Hungarian is a totally messed up language. It sounds nothing like other slavic languages so I couldn't really ask for directions. I found my hostel two hours later, sweaty, gross and exhausted but I was so glad to be there. The hostel was so clean and smelled really nice. I slept like a baby that night. I also slept easy knowing that you were in the same city. Even though we were not in the same room, I felt that I was with you that night. \n\nAnyway, I wandered aimlessly around the city. I got lost a multiple times and deep down I was thinking would it be awesome if I bumped into Mike right now? Anyway I found myself near the parliament by the river bank and I looked at the river. Then a little breeze brushed my face and something made me turn my head to the left. I saw you standing there in the distance, further down the river bank. Our eyes locked and I everything stopped, everything. I saw nothing but you and I've never felt happier in my entire life. We spent the rest of the day together. We toured the Parliament, watch Brazil get destroyed during the world cup and then we destroyed a bathroom at that nice hostel. I felt so bad the next morning . We nearly broke off the sink. We didn't make love though. I didn't think that I would deserve someone as beautiful as you and I told you. You walked away without saying anything and we never saw each other again. But hey, life is not a movie and our movie isn't over yet :) \n\nP.s. I thought of the robins when I heard your bell. \n\nI am a poor freezingly cold soul\nSo far from where I intended to go\nScavenging through life's very constant lows\nSo far from where I'm determined to go\n\nWish I knew the way to reach the one I love\nThere is no way\nWish I had the charm to attract the one I love\nBut you see, I've got no charm\n\nTonight I've consumed much more than I can hold\nOh, this is very clear to you\nAnd you can tell I have never really loved\nYou can tell, by the way, I sleep all day\n\nAnd all of my life no one gave me anything\nNo one has ever given me anything\nMy love is as sharp as a needle in your eye\nYou must be such a fool to pass me by    "

It looked different, smelled different, I didn't recognize anyone. I couldn't understand anyone and nobody could understand me. I learned English pretty fast but the voice of if just sounded so foreign to me in my head. The words that I spoke had no meaning. The word heartbroken is nothing but a sound when you never had a broken heart. When I write it down it doesn't mean anything. But I now what it means to have your heart broken it really helps writing it down. I can feel the words if you know what I mean. I used to keep a diary as a kid because I felt that I couldn't really talk to anyone. I always felt so out of place and so insecure because I didn't how to truly get along with anyone. I got along with myself though. I felt no shame when writing down words on paper because a paper won't judge you. People will which is why you should delete your reddit account right now. Save what you wrote though so that you can look at it and feel ashamed for whoring yutself . You can't be a good writer if you can't be honest with yourself. Isn't that the point if writing to begin with? I'm just asking, actually. I'd love to know what you think good writing is. Though I have a fair idea since I learned it all from you :)\n\nI believe that there is this warm place buried deep in our chest. It feels like little flames are tickling the inside of my ribcage. Breaking your heart gets that fire started.\n\nYou cracked it open on December 31, 2012 when you responded to my POF message. I think I still remember what I wrote. I said something like: Hey I know that look on your face, I'm making the same face. I went into some kind of trance when I saw your picture. I looked straight into your eyes and I thought they were the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. I thought they are the most calming shade of blue I've ever seen. I saw that color in the sky once when I was at my mom's. I was sitting out on the windowsill, smoking a cigarette. I felt so weird. I mean I was at home but I wasn't. I felt no connection to the place anymore because it changed so much. It was around 4 in the morning and I just finished binge watching Orange is the Black on my ipad. I couldn't sleep. I was looking at the sky and the river under it and as the first rays of sun touched the night sky, I saw that blue again and felt home. It reminded me of home and everything that home means: comfort, warmth; a cocoon. And I was in there with you. Everytime I think of you, I'm home. I don't care where I am, you can remember places when you try hard enough but home is not a place, it's a feeling and I get that everytime I think of you. I doesn't matter    "

I wish I said something to you but I got super shy... kinda told my friend to stay for a few minutes just so I could look at you again haha. And I stood at a diagonal to you just thinking about that smile and how handsome you are. Had a weird feeling like we would probably connect well if we did talk.... Kicking myself now!!

This is a long shot, but if you read this, I'd love to chat again!    "

I watched from half a block away across the street and ran towards them as a few other men jumped in to protect the girls. The guy began swinging and hitting the men who were jumping in. \n\nBy the time I was close, a cop arrived and the guy fled. The cop chased the guy down the street while I stayed and spoke to Lilly and Sophie who were still shook up from the fight. We waited about 15 minutes for the cop to return with the guy in hand cuffs, but he didn't return at all, and after saying they were okay, the girls thanked me and went on their way. \n\nI kept thinking about how shook up they were, and I regretted not helping them home, or taking down their information. If by some long shot you're reading this, or if you know about this incident and know the girls involved, please reply. Would love to reach out somehow, just to ask them if they're okay now, and if they want to hang out under normal and happier circumstances, I'm down.
